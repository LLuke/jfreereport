1.  WHAT's NEW
---------------
A list of changes in recent versions:

0.9.1:    (27-Jun-2007)
        * Normalized the build-files so that the build.xml file now sits in
	  the root directory. 
	  
	! As liblayout is still broken, the demos will show very strange 
	  results. 

0.9.0-01  (11-Dec-2006)
        * A couple of new demos:
        
          - Quadrant-Subreport: Shows how to use sub-reports
          
           Auto-Table: Demonstrates the 'Auto-Table' capabilities
          
          - LayoutController: Shows how to build a custom layout-controller
            and how to register it in the XML-Parsers and the central
            LayoutControllerFactory

0.9.0:    (3-Dec-2006)
        * What's new: Everything!

          - SubReports, FormulaSupport, Complex Layouts, Elements that can
            span more than one page - we got 'em all.

          JFreeReport 0.9 is a complete rewrite of the good old JFreeReport
          engine. One of the ugly consequences of that rewrite is the total
          loss of backward compatiblity.

          With JFreeReport 0.9 we dropped the absolute-positioned banded
          report paradigm and entered the world of Document centric reports.

          For more details on what has changed and what is still on the ToDo
          list, have a look at the JFreeReport site and forum.

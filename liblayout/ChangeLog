A list of changes in recent versions:

0.1.1: (30-Apr-2006)
        * LibLayout now depends on a modified version of flute - W3C's CSS-Parser.
          Our version has improved namespace awareness, while maintaining backward
          compatiblity with the original semantics (to allow co-existence with 
          BIRT). The stylesheets provided in LibLayout will not work properly with
          an unpatched version of the parser.

        * Namespace awareness has been improved. Namespace-characteristics can
          be defined by the document within the Document's MetaData section.

        * Removed all traces of JFreeReport namespaces. The namespaces and the
          default style are now part of JFreeReport (or any other library).

          LibLayout's stylesheet now only contains helper rules for its own
          internal use (like list markers or other meant-to-be-pseudo-elements
          definitions).

0.1.0: (17-Apr-2006)
        * Initial release

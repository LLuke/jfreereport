************************

30 Apr 2006

1. INTRODUCTION
---------------
LibLayout is a layouting framework. It is based on the Cascading StyleSheets
standard (in the upcoming version 3). The layouting expects to receive its
content as a DOM structure (although it does not rely on the W3C-DOM API).

For the latest news and information about LibLayout, please refer to:

Like all JFreeReport related projects, LibLayout upholds the good tradition
of compatibility to JDK 1.2.2.

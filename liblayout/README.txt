1. INTRODUCTION
---------------
LibLayout is a layouting framework. It is based on the Cascading StyleSheets
standard (in the upcoming version 3). The layouting expects to receive its
content as a DOM structure (although it does not rely on the W3C-DOM API).

For the latest news and information about LibLayout, please refer to:

    http://jfreereport.pentaho.org/liblayout/


Like all JFreeReport related projects, LibLayout upholds the good tradition
of compatibility to JDK 1.2.2.


2. SUPPORT
----------
Free support is available via the JFreeReport forum, follow the link
from the JFreeReport home page.  Please note that questions are
answered by volunteers, so there is no guaranteed response time or
level of service.

Please avoid e-mailing the developers directly for support questions.
If you post a message in the forum, then everyone can see the
question, and everyone can see the answer.


3. REPORTING BUGS
-----------------
If you find bugs in JFreeReport, we'd like to hear about it so that we
can improve future releases of JFreeReport.  Please post a bug report
at the JFreeReport project page on SourceForge:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/jfreereport

Please be sure to provide as much information as you can.  We need to
know the version of JFreeReport that you are using, the JDK version,
and the steps required to replicate the bug.  Include any other
information that you think is relevant.


4. ANT
------
We use an open source build tool called Ant to build JFreeReport.  An
Ant script (tested using Ant 1.6) is included in the distribution:

    <libfonts-directory>/ant/build.xml

You can find out more about Ant at:

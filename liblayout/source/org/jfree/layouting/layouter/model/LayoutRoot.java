 * The layout root is the document/page representation in the DOM model.
 * It holds the page-wide settings. It is initialized with the document
 * context and will hold all undeclared counters.
 *
 * Unlike all other elements, this root has no layout-context. Any call
 * to this method will result in a Null-value to be returned. On pagebreaks,
 * no new instance needs to be generated - the layout root exists only once.

    * Changed the grammar to accept namespaces. As we have to co-exist with
      Birt, we can't change the overal semantics; therefore we map the raw-
      strings into the single name-property and leave the namespace parameter
      unused.

      LibLayout's SelectorFactory later parses that raw-format and translates
      the prefixes into URIs. The same happens for attribute values for the
      'attr(..)' function (This seems to be the only place in the value space,
      where namespaces are used at all.)

      While working on it, I changed what seemed to be a bug in the LexicalUnit
      class: 'Ident'-Units should not print themself as 'attr(..)' functions.

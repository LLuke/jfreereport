1.  WHAT's NEW
---------------
A list of changes in recent versions:

0.1.1:
        * Functions use a parameter callback now. This way, we avoid to pre-
          evaluate all the parameters and therefore optimize the evaluation of
          the whole formula.

0.1.0: (06-Nov-2006)
        * Initial version. This version happily deals with plain types and
          somehow it even handles arrays without crashing. Code for database
          support exists, but is not in a usable state (yet).

          I don't even think about OLAP cubes now.

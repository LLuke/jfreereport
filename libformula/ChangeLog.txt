1.  WHAT's NEW
---------------
A list of changes in recent versions:

0.1.7: (27-Apr-2007)
        * [BUG] Fixed a couple of type-conversion issues when converting from and
          to numeric types. Now, if a value is not convertible, a 
          TypeConversionException will be thrown.

0.1.6: (01-Apr-2007)
        * [BUG] Comparing two untyped (Any-Type) values always failed. The new
          implementation now tries to convert these values into Numbers, Dates,
          and Strings to compare them. (This is a quick-fix for Bug #1680148;
          however, it needs more testing before we can close that bug.)

        * New functions added
          Date:
          - NOW()
          - TODAY()

0.1.5: (07-Mar-2007)
        * Exposed some previously private variables to allow proper inspection
          of formulas.

0.1.4: (01-Mar-2007)
        * [BUG] The parser did not accept empty parameters so that syntactilly
          valid formulas like "IF(;;;)" failed to parse.

        * [BUG] The TRIM(..) function was invalid. TRIM has to remove all
          leading, trailing and all duplicate inner whitespaces from the give
          text.

        * New functions added
          Text:
          - REPLACE(
          - SUBSTITUTE(text, old_text, new_text, nth_appearance )

          Math:
          - ABS(number)

          Date:
          - DATEDIF(date1,date2,interval)

0.1.3: (25-Jan-2007)
        * [BUG] The power operator was not registered.

        * [BUG] The 'minus' prefix operator did not work.

        * New functions added
          Text:
          - LEFT(text[,length=1])
          - EXACT(text1,text2)
          - FIND(needle,hay[,startIndex])
          - LEN(text)
          - LOWER(text)
          - MID(text,start,length)
          - REPT(text,count)
          - TEXT(value)
          - T(value)
          - TRIM(text)
          - UPPER(text)
          - URLENCODE(text[,encoding])

          Information:
          - NA
          - ISNA(value)
          - ISTEXT(value)
          - ISLOGICAL(value)
          - ISERROR(value)
          - CHOOSE(condition,value[,..])
          - ISBLANK(value)

0.1.2: (22-Dec-2006)
        * [BUG] The parser failed when being faced with functions that have
          no parameters.

        * New function NULL allows to return a NULL-reference.

        * Added the 'ISBLANK' function from OpenFormula.

0.1.1: (11-Dec-2006)
        * The FormulaContext now is able to signal errors using Exceptions.

          The ToDo list has grown a bit after studying the holy books of
          Formula-computation. Version 0.2 will see some major internal API
          changes.

0.1.0: (03-Dec-2006)
        * Initial version. This version happily deals with plain types and
          somehow it even handles arrays without crashing. Code for database
          support exists, but is not in a usable state (yet).

          I don't even think about OLAP cubes now.

        * Functions use a parameter callback now. This way, we avoid to pre-
          evaluate all the parameters and therefore optimize the evaluation of
          the whole formula.

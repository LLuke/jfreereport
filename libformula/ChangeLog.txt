1.  WHAT's NEW
---------------
A list of changes in recent versions:


0.1.2: (20-Dec-2006)
        * [BUG] The parser failed when being faced with functions that have
          no parameters.
          
        * New function NULL allows to return a NULL-reference.

0.1.1: (11-Dec-2006)
        * The FormulaContext now is able to signal errors using Exceptions.
        
          The ToDo list has grown a bit after studying the holy books of
          Formula-computation. Version 0.2 will see some major internal API
          changes.

0.1.0: (03-Dec-2006)
        * Initial version. This version happily deals with plain types and
          somehow it even handles arrays without crashing. Code for database
          support exists, but is not in a usable state (yet).

          I don't even think about OLAP cubes now.

        * Functions use a parameter callback now. This way, we avoid to pre-
          evaluate all the parameters and therefore optimize the evaluation of
          the whole formula.

1.  WHAT's NEW

A list of changes in recent versions:

0.1.0: (06-Nov-2006)
        * Initial version. This version happily deals with plain types and
          somehow it even handles arrays without crashing. Code for database
          support exists, but is not in a usable state (yet).

          I don't even think about OLAP cubes now.

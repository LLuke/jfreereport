<h3>JFreeReport servlet examples</h3>
<ul>
    <li><a href="pdfreport">PDF-Servlet</a>
    <p>
    This example generates a PDF file and opens this file in the current
    browser window using your favourite PDF-plugin.
    </p>
    <li><a href="htmlreport">HTML-Servlet</a>
    <p>
    This generates a stream-HTML file. The main restriction of StreamHTML is
    that no images will be generated, so the icons column will remain empty.
    The only image type supported is the external referenced image, a image
    supplied by an HTML or FTP url.
    </p><p>
    If you want to generate images and publish them using a servlet or JSP, then
    you'll have to switch to either the DirHtmlFilesystem or the ZipHtmlFilesystem.
    Both output systems are able to generate and manage generated images.
    </p>
    <li><a href="pngreport?page=0">First page of the JPEG-Servlet</a>
    <p>
    This prints the first page of the demo report as PNG file. It is a simple and
    quick example, how to reference a page from the PNG-Servlet.
    </p>
    <li><a href="png-servlet-frontend.jsp">The complete PNG report</a>
    <p>
    This JSP wraps up the PNG report process and generates a HTML file, which
    contains the generated PNG files. The generated html page contains all PNG
    files, it should be easy to modify the provided page and add browsing over
    the generated content. This task is left to the readed as excercise :)
    </p>
    <li><a href="xlsreport">Excel-Servlet</a>
    <p>
    This example generates an Excel file. The file will not contain any
    images, as POI does not support this feature yet.
    </p>
    <li><a href="html-include.jsp">HTML Report as JSP-Include</a>
    <p>
    In this example, the new BodyFragment generation code is used to embedd
    the generated content into the calling web page.
    </p>

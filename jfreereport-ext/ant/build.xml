<!-- An ANT build file for JFreeReport -->

<!-- Based on a script written by David Gilbert -->

<!-- To run this script, you need to make sure the libraries used by -->
<!-- JFreeReport are copied to the ../lib directory (or edit the -->
<!-- init-general task to point to the appropriate jar files). -->

<!-- This script will create temporary directories ../build and -->
<!-- ../distribution, as working areas.  A ../javadoc directory will -->
<!-- be created for the Javadoc HTML pages. -->

<!-- If you have comments about this script, please post a message -->
<!-- in the JFreeReport forum. -->

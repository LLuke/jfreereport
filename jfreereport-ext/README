JFreeReport extensions
----------------------

The classes in this subproject extend JFreeReport with additional 
functionality. While the base package uses only a limited number of 
external libraries to perform the report generation (and remains small
and clean), most advanced usage scenarios require additional functionality 
which is usually provided by an almost infinite number of external libraries.

The extensions here rely on JFreeReport while the base classes keep their
clean and simple structures. Hopefully most classes in this subproject will
keep a modular structure so that the user can remove unneeded parts easily.

All extension packages will be located under the package 
com.jrefinery.report.ext.

Note:
When adding functionality that requires additional libraries make sure that
all depencies are documented.


JFreeReport Tests:
------------------

JUnit test will be located in com.jrefinery.report.ext.junit and get removed
from the base package.

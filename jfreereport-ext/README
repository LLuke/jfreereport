JFreeReport extensions
----------------------

The classes in this subproject extend JFreeReport with additional 
functionality. While the base package uses only a limited number of 
external libraries to perform the report generation (and remains small
and clean), most advanced usage scenarios require additional functionality 
which is usually provided by an almost infinite number of external libraries.

The extensions here rely on JFreeReport while the base classes keep their
clean and simple structures. Hopefully most classes in this subproject will
keep a modular structure so that the user can remove unneeded parts easily.

All extension packages will be located under the package 
com.jrefinery.report.ext.

Note:
When adding functionality that requires additional libraries make sure that
all depencies are documented.

Building
------------------

When rebuilding the sources, make sure, that you have all required libraries
in your classpath or exclude these classes, that should not be build.

The provided ANT script checks, whether the required libraries for certain
classes are there, if in doubt, then use this script to compile the sources.

The required libraries for a complete build are:

servlet.jar     - The Servlet package "javax.servlet" is available from Sun.
junit.jar       - The JUnit test library, available from "www.junit.org"
log4j-1.2.3.jar - The Log4J logging framework: "jakarta.apache.org".
JDK 1.4         - For the Java1.4 style logging support


JFreeReport Tests:
------------------

JUnit test will be located in com.jrefinery.report.ext.junit and get removed
from the base package.


LogTargets
------------------

Enhanced log targets for the Log4J library and the Java 1.4 logging implementation
are provided in the package com.jrefinery.report.ext.log.

A list of changes in recent versions:

0.9.2: (01-Apr-2007)
    * Improved the ability to create XML-Snipplets and to embed the XMLWriter's
      output in other content.

0.9.1: (07-Mar-2007)
    * LibLoader's new resource-key system required some change.

0.9.0: (25-Jan-2007)
    * LibXML is feature complete. Both the parser and writer classes
      are doing what they should and adding anything else would add extra
      code for no real value.

    * The XMLWriterSupport does no longer define the namespaces on a per-document
      basis. Namespaces are declared using attributes and are inherited to all
      child-elements. Namespaces can be redefined on each element, if needed.

    * The parser now follows the Namespace standard and accepts namespace
      declarations on all elements.

    * Some first source-code documentation has been added.

0.2.1: (22-Dec-2006)
    * Improved the parsing of xml files that have a DTD. A handler can
      now map the DTD into a default namespace. All elements for that
      document type will have the namespace asigned.

0.2.0: (03-Dec-2006)
    * Added the XMLWriterSupport and better tag managment.

    * Each LibXml parser has now access the LibLoader-ResourceKey that was
      used to load the Xml-Document.

0.1.1: (30-Jul-2006)
    * More changes to the parser.

0.1.0: (29-Jun-2006)
    * Initial release of LibXML

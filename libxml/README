1. INTRODUCTION
---------------

LibXML is a namespace aware SAX-Parser utility library. It eases the
pain of implementing non-trivial SAX input handlers. The original
code of these classes had been written by Peter Becker for the
JCommon library.

LibXML replaces the JCommon classes, which were not namespace aware.
Due to JCommons frozen API, namespace awareness could not be added to
the original code without creating a mess.

5.  WHAT's NEW
---------------
A list of changes in recent versions:
0.8.5-3: (??)
        * [BUG] The GUI-ExportTasks now create missing directories, if
          necessary. The HTML-Directory Export's data directory is now
          relative to the specified HTML file and no longer to the current
          working directory.

        * [BUG] Merging lines and backgrounds in the TableExports was invalid.

        * [BUG] StaticLayoutManager's caching worked to hard and stored
          intermediate values, which caused elements with a fixed width and
          relative height to be way to large.

        * [BUG] The 'pagebreak-before-print' and 'pagebreak-after-print' of
           the SimpleXML DTD were inconsistent. Now all pagebreak attributes
           use the names given above, as these attribute names have been
           used for the group header/footer for some time. (closes #1165942)

        * [BUG] TableBackground-borders with a width of '0' should not be
          activated. Such borders must have their color set to 'null'.
          (closes #1166296)

        * [BUG] Duplicate logging of the project info can be confusing.
          Removed the log statement from JFreeReportBoot. (closes #1166415)

        * [BUG] The PDF default encoding of the module configuration was set to
          Cp1251 (which is cyrillic) but should have been set to Cp1252 (WinAnsi)
          (closes #1165907)

        * [BUG] The output-pageable-base module did not jave the output-meta
          jar file included in the classpath. This seems to kill the demo on
          some systems. (closes #1168342)

        * [BUG] The HTML-Export now uses the fixed table-layout alogorithm as
          specified in the CSS-standard. Additionally, the total width of
          the table is now specified in the table tag to help the HTML renderer.
          Column widths are now specified using the '<col>' tag. (closes #1165992)

        * [BUG] The HTML-Export does no longer generate &nbsp; for empty cells.
          The CSS-property "empty-cells: show" is used instead. (closes #1168156)

        * [BUG] In the Excel-Export row heights and cell widths were unreliable.
          The row height are now set according to the POI documentation (1/1440th
          of an inch as unit).

          For the cell heights Arial 10 is set as default font and all cell
          heights are computed with an assumed character width of 5 points.
          The way how cell widths are computed is way to weird, you wouldn't
          believe it (I still have problems to believe it). 

        * The Demo-Jar now uses the DemoFrontend class as Main class. This way,
          all demos are accessible when running that jar.


0.8.5-2: (18-Mar-2005)
        * [BUG] FontPath caching did not validate the cache integrety. This way,
          some fonts might be left unregistered.

        * [BUG] The image content class did not refuse bounds with a
          width or height of zero. Such content would never be displayable
          and should therefore be removed as early as possible.

          In the same class, the image scaling code tried to use an integer
          division to compute the scale factor. That resulted in a scale factor
          of zero in all down-scale operations.

        * [BUG] Drawing scaled image content was wrong in PDF and Graphics2D
          targets. The HTML target did use the unscaled image size instead of
          the computed (scaled) bounds for the <img> tag.

        * [BUG] PageHeader/Footer handler of the SimpleXML parser did not
          parse the onfirst/lastpage attribute. The ReportHeader/Footer handler
          did not parse the (deprecated) ownpage attribute.

        * Added verbose warning messages if image loading failed.

        * Added deprecation warnings for the old report DTDs.

        * All Export Dialogs use lazy initializations now, wherever possible.
          This way, the preview dialogs show up a lot faster than before.     

0.8.5-1: (10-Mar-2005)
        * [BUG] The PDF did not setup the first page correctly.

        * [BUG] Images were not exported to PDF due to a bug in the
          clipping setup.

        * [BUG] filling shapes seemed to put the output target into an
          invalid state; therefore an alternative way to draw and fill
          shapes and process Drawables has been implemented.

0.8.5: (4-Mar-2005)
        * The modules are now named after their java package names and
          correspond now with the jar file name.

        * The naming schema for the jar files changed to fit the common
          naming schema used in Maven and other OpenSource projects.

        * All output target generate 'output-complete' events whenever
          a root level band has been successfully printed.

        * Most of the deprecated code has been removed. Due to the heavy
          nature of the other changes, also many non deprecated methods
          have changed.

        * All ResourceBundles used by JFreeReport have been converted to
          property files for better maintainability.

        * The Boot process of JFreeReport now integrates into the jcommon
          boot system; a new boot loader implementation (JFreeReportBoot)
          provides the boot loader for this library.

        * Images are no longer required to be loadable. The ImageReference
          interface is used to define the image sizes and URLs. There is
          no need to load the image anymore. This allows references to
          image sources, which are not reachable for the report generator.

        * Images and Drawables are now loaded using a separate factory,
          so that Pixie is no longer a hardcoded requirement. If during
          the boot process the Pixie library is detected, support for WMF
          images and drawable will be available.

        * All output targets use 'MetaBands' to produce their spool
          content. This makes implementing other target less error prone.

        * In the pageable output targets, the report state list is no
          longer public. All state information is now handled by the
          pageable report processor so that there is no way to tamper
          with internal states.

        * The PlainTextOutput targets have been completly rewritten.
          (thanks Michael Tennes for all the debugging, patience and
          tips and tricks).

        * This implementation has now a complete ESC/P printer driver
          and makes sure that your epson compatible matrix printers will
          have some happy days in the Java world.

        * The table targets have been completly rewritten. The old
          implementation produced invalid results and was impossible to
          debug.

        * HTML targets now support body fragment generation. This makes
          it possible to use the output from JFreeReport in JSP-Include
          files.

        * The RTF target is now fixed and considered stable enough to be
          fully supported. Images are still unsupported, as this consumes
          to much memory to be handled safely for now.

        * The Excel target now allows alternate cell-format definitions.
          This resolves issues, where Excel's internal format definitions
          are incompatible with the Java definitions.

        * The numeric and date data cells now use the original raw data
          instead of parsing the formatted content string. This preserves
          the full precision of the contained data.

        * Functions and Expressions now use the bean-interface for their
          configuration; the explicit use of setProperties (..) has been
          removed in favor of the get/set methods of the Bean-API.

          The parsers currently support parameters of the following types:
          - java.math.BigDecimal
          - java.math.BigInteger
          - java.lang.Boolean
          - java.lang.Byte
          - java.lang.Character
          - java.lang.Class
          - java.awt.Color
          - java.lang.Double
          - java.lang.Float
          - java.lang.Integer
          - java.lang.Long
          - java.lang.Short
          - java.lang.String
          as well as all primitive values and all values that define a
          java.beans.PropertyEditor that supports the configuration using
          PropertyEditor.getAsText() and PropertyEditor.setAsText().

        * A PageDefinition object is now used instead of the
          java.awt.print.PageFormat object. This will allow the definition of
          printing areas that consist of multiple physical pages.

          The support for larger than 1x1 page-set is untested and should be
          considered experimental for now.

        * ReportStates allow access to the current page definition object from
          within functions. The ReportProperty "report.pageformat" should not
          be used anymore. That property will contain the first page format.
          Obviously, this is invalid, if more than one pageformat is defined.

        * The page definition is now the only source for the page format;
          all constructors accepting page formats have been removed from
          the report processors.

        * The ReportConnectable interface replaces the DataRowConnectable
          to allow access to the complete report definition during the data
          preprocessing.

        * Resourcebundles for the ResourceFields are no longer loaded directly.
          The ResourceBundleFactory from the ReportDefinition object is now
          used as source for the ResourceBundle.

        * Function and expression handling is now unified. The distinction
          between the various function types is now classified as an internal
          secret. For the users, functions should be not more than a special
          kind of expressions.

        * Root-Level bands can now have a fixed start position on the page.
          This solves the various requests for the report or group footers
          printed at the bottom of the page. Be aware that the Layout-Engine
          will abort the report generation, if the fixed footer does not fit
          completly on the current page. Using dynamic elements in such bands
          can cause trouble.

        * TextElements bind the encoding of their content; multiple encodings
          can be used within a single PDF document (that feature has been
          silently implemented in the later 0.8.4 versions, and is now ready
          to be used officially)

        * Horizontal lines no longer use the x1==x2; y1==y2 form of definition.
          They now use the relative coordinates like all other elements
          (width="100%") Special factory methods have been added to the
          StaticShapeElementFactory so that vertical and horizontal lines can
          be generated more easily.

        * LayoutManagerCache now uses the Element's InstanceID as key for the
          cache. This increases the performance a lot (HugeReport6: from 84 sec
          to 35 secs). Elements that will have their sizes or position be modified
          by the user must be marked uncachable by using the stylekey
          ELEMENT_LAYOUT_CACHABLE set to 'false', or the layout might be invalid.
          Dynamic elements are never cachable.

        * The PDF target caches the used images. It also does no longer try to
          encode all images as PNG files - this was completly unnecessay and
          just stupid.

        * Some minor performance improvements have been made in the stylekey handling.

        * An userdefined configuration can be added to the ReportConfiguration.
          This way JFreeReport can use other frameworks as configuration source.
          (Based on a suggestion by 'bitstorm').

          Use the 'setUserConfig' method of the ReportConfiguration class to
          include the configuration implementation.

        * The XML-parsers can be used to configure an predefined JFreeReport
          instance. This makes it possible to supply an own JFreeReport
          implementation to the parser..

        * The PageFinished event is now handled correctly. This catches all
          pagebreak related bugs.

        * MessageFormatElements (contributed by Joerg Schaible) have been added.
          These elements allow to join and format text in a similiar way as it
          is possible with the TextFormatExpression.

          DataRow-columns get referenced by using $(columnname) instead of
          the parameter index of the MessageFormat format string. 

        * A PageOfPagesFunction (contributed by Joerg Schaible) greatly
          reduces the complexity when defining the common 'Page x of y'
          fields.

        * All Preview components now use a factory method "protected
          PreviewProxyBase createPreviewProxyBase ()" to create the
          ProxyBaseImplementation. This should make it easier to replace
          the PreviewProxyBase with a custom implementation.

        * PDF- and HTML-Targets now support Anchors and Hyperlinks.

        * The ElementStyleSheets have a cleaner semantic now. There are
          two classes of stylesheets, the ones assigned directly to the
          elements and bands and the global ones, which are created and
          managed by the StyleSheetCollection.

          Only on default parent can exist, and one cascading parent,
          which links the elements to its parent bands. Bands do no longer
          have two unrelated stylesheets, now they inherit their primary
          stylesheet to their parents. This way, the inheritance change
          can go from the root level band to the last child, allowing the
          same inheritance chain as found in the cascading stylesheets.

          The BandDefaults have been removed.

        * Simple XML parser has been completly rewritten and uses now a
          framework initially created by Peter Becker. Support for the new
          features has been added.

        * Support for Include-files added to allow to reuse common parts
          of the report definitions (like report header/footer,
          page header/footer, or everything else)

          There is no limitation in how many reports get included or in
          which XML-format was used as definition format.

        * Support for the ImageIO API of JDK1.4 has been added to JFreeReport-Ext.
          As soon as JFreeReport-Ext is on the classpath, the resource factory
          will start to use these new image loaders.

        * BarCode support has been added by Mimil (JFreeReport-ext).

        * The servlet demos have been updated to demonstrate the use of
          custom URLImageContainer implementations to include images in
          StreamHtmlReports (JFreeReport-ext).

        * The ExportDialogs have been redesigned to behave a little bit better.
          All the annoying popup windows have been replaced by a less annyoing
          status bar.

        * BugFix: The layout manager did not align elements according to the
          output target's properties. This made plain text output almost impossible.

0.8.4-11: (13-Oct-2004)

        * BugFix: Watermark-Band elements were not connected to the
          datarow, causing all non-static elements to fail.

        * BugFix: Selecting fonts in the PlainText-OutputTarget was not
          supported.

        * BugFix: JFreeReport now uses the latest JCommon to fix that
          nasty recompile problem when used together with JFreeChart.

        * BugFix: Changing PageFormats was buggy and caused the margins
          of the page to be swapped.

        * BugFix: The ItemMin- and ItemMaxFunction where inizialized in
          an invalid way and therefore not working as expected.

        * BugFix: The PDF-OutputTarget always created PDFs with embedded
          fonts, defining the embedded value in the configuration had no
          effect. To fix that, a new constructor was added which does no
          longer set the embedded property.

        * BugFix: PDF-Font creation caused OutOfMemoryErrors in case the
          font creation failed several times before. Support for truetype
          collections was not correctly implemented.

        * A new function was added to support pagefooter printing on only
          the last page.

        * David Gilbert created a new module to support survey reports.
          The SurveyScaleDemo shows how to use that new feature. The survey
          module is not yet configurable with the XML report definitions,
          this will be included in later versions of JFreeReport.

        * Two new demos show, how it is possible to misuse the page-footer to
          print a report-footer at the bottom of the last page.

        * The used libraries were updated to the latest stable versions
          available.

0.8.4-10: (27-Apr-2004)

        * BugFix: Excel export threw exceptions if an background
          spanned more than one row or column

        * BugFix: PDF and RTF export failed on non-embedded fonts.

        * BugFix: The Simple XML parser threw exceptions if a
          number or date-field definition did not specify a format
          string.

        * BugFix: Replacing the report object in the preview dialogs
          could cause the next reporting to fail with an
          "ReportInterruptedException". This was caused by not waiting
          for the repagination worker to shutdown properly.

        * BugFix: The ReportWriter caused trouble when trying to write
          DecimalFormat objects. Fixed is contained in jcommon-0.9.3a.

        * A new demo shows how to use conditional groups.

        * The swedish translations were updated by Ulf Ekström.

        * The PlainText target now offers the option to specify an
          initialization string, which is sent to the printer before
          any other content is printed.

        * JFreeReport now compiles on JDK 1.5 without warnings.

0.8.4-9: (6-Apr-2004)
        * BugFix: The BaseFontSupport and the PDF output target
          did not handle iText fonts correctly resulting in a
          memory leak.

        * BugFix: An exception occured whenever a band flagged with
          "pagebreak-after" did not fit on the previous page and was
          printed during the page-open process

        * BugFix: The TableTargets did not format row/colspanned cells
          correctly. Credits for detecting this bug goes to mechiland.

        * BugFix: The HTML Target did not close all table data elements.
          Credits for detecting this bug goes to mechiland.

        * BugFix: The paint component function did not layout given the components
          correctly. Using non-opaque components did not produce valid results.

        * BugFix: The PageFormatFactory did not correctly convert millimeters
          into points. (2nd Try)

        * BugFix: The font path detection of the itext-support was not
          case insensitive causing wrong results on some systems.
          Thanks mechiland for your reports.

        * BugFix: Fixed some typos

        * BugFix: Fixed several synchronization issues with singleton implementations

        * Whether a repeating group header should be printed for a lonely
          group footer can now be configured using the report configuration.

        * ResultSetTableModel classes now try to recover from errors when
          examining column types. Thanks, Roger Hayes for your great code.

        * Introduced better support for form printing by adding a "fixed-position"
          stylekey. Group- and report header and -footer and the itemband can now
          be printed at a fixed position on the page.

        * New Demo: Invoice demo shows a complexer invoice example.

        * New Demo: Form demo shows a simple patient form and demonstrates the usage
          of the new fixed-position key.

0.8.4-8: (04-Feb-2004)
        * BugFix: The ConfigStore module was totally messed up.

        * BugFix: The PlainTextExport contained a really strange
          implementation to handle borders. That thing did not work
          as expected and was removed.

        * BugFix: Many, many synchronization issues resolved. Most
          of the old stuff was incomplete or just stupid. Hopefully
          it is better now :)

        * BugFix: The report footer's ownpage attribute was not handled
          correctly in the simple xml parser.

        * Dialogs now store the last user input for a certain report.
          The input is keyed by the report's name, so it is important
          to give every report a unique name.

        * Group exception messages and SizeCalculator exceptions are
          more chatty now.

        * The BOUNDS style is no longer written when serializing reports.

        * The baseURL of the ImageURL* Templates will no longer be written.
          The baseURL points to the URL of the report definition and is
          set by the parser.

        * The PreviewComponent's toolbar has now the option to add a
          close button to the toolbar.

        * The PreviewComponent's toolbar now allows to add custom actions
          to the toolbar. The actions must be supplied in the "customActions"
          action map.

        * The Drawable renderer of the PDF output now uses the BaseFontFactory
          to resolve font requests.

        * Whether a ProgressDialog or the progressBar is shown is configurable
          now. The progressdialog can be configured for every export plugin;
          the progress bar is only available in the preview frame and cannot
          be used to monitor the export progress.

0.8.4-7:
        * BugFix: The simple parser did not handle the font encoding
          attribute of bands correctly.

        * BugFix: Hidden root level bands should not consume any space.

        * BugFix: Javac 1.2 complained a lot about coding errors. The
          errors it noticed weren't there, but the code changed to make
          that stupid thing shut up.

        * BugFix: The PageFormatFactory did not correctly convert millimeters
          into points.

        * BugFix: The HTML export created buggy code; The head-tag was not
          closed properly and the <td> tags contained invalid widths if
          the columns defined a colspan.

        * BugFix: PageHeader and -footer now obey to both the "display-on-first-page"
          and "display-on-last-page" flag.

        * All supplied jars are now built with JDK1.2 to get rid of the
          AbstractMethodExceptions caused by the JDK1.4 class files.

        * Support for watermark-bands was added.

0.8.4-6 (25-Nov-2003):
        * BugFix: In some cases the band layout manager "lost" the
          reference to the local LayoutSupport. This part was ugly
          and was completly rewritten.

        * BugFix: Repeating group headers were lost if the printing
          of the group footer of that group was delayed until a new
          page was started. The inner most group header was not printed
          in such cases.

        * BugFix: Exceptions in the SimplePageLayouter may be lost when
          the clearCurrentEvent() method throws an other exception. This
          was stupid coding and this method does no longer throw that
          unnecessary exception causing all the trouble.

        * The preview components are now fully configurable. The creation
          and contents of the toolbar and menubar can now be controlled
          using the report configuration.

        * The preview base is reuseable now. The report can be redefined
          using the setReport(..) method.
          
        * The Total* Function now support a global computation, if no
          group is defined. They do no longer depend on the existence
          of the default group.

        * JFreeReport now prints the current version of the Core-Module
          during the boot process.
           
0.8.4-5 (07-Nov-2003):
        * BugFix: The report footer was not printed, if an automatic
          pagebreak was done right before the printing of the footer.

        * BugFix: Minor fixes in the simple parser to improve
          the quality of the generated report definition.

        * BugFix: DrawableTemplate did not implement DataRowConnectable
          and was not available in the ext-parser.

        * The export plugins of the GUI are better configurable now.
          The report configuration can be used to define, whether a
          plugin will appear separated from previous menu entries or
          whether the export will be selectable from the toolbar.

        * The ResultSetTableModelFactory can now be configured to map
          either ColumnNames or ColumnLabels to the column indices.

        * The PreviewBase has been reworked to be more extensible.

0.8.4-4 (01-Nov-2003):
        * BugFix: TotalItemCountFunction is now serializable and handles
          nested groups correctly.

        * BugFix: ExportPlugins had a weird way of registering themself on
          the ReportProgressDialogs

        * BugFix: SimplePageLayouter did not implement getInstance() correctly.

        * BugFix: TextElement.setLineHeight tried to use Integer where Float
          was expected causing ClassCastExceptions.

        * BugFix: The PackageManager did not accept some of the version strings
          correctly causing all export plugins to fail. Additionally all
          warnings were surpressed.

        * TextElements can now trim the textlines to make the aligned content
          look properly.

        * The simple xml parser now allows to define the reserved-literal, the
          string which is appended when a text does not fully fit into the
          elements bounds. Additionally, the simple parser now can define the
          trim-text property for all text elements.

        * A new demo shows the usage of ReportProperties.

0.8.4-3 (22-Oct-2003):
        * BugFix: PlainText output fixed. It was funnily messed up when
          handling borders and was fed in the wrong way by some of the demos.

        * BugFix: TotalItemCountFunction fixed; another stupid Copy&Paste
          bug :(

0.8.4-2 (19-Oct-2003):
        * BugFix: Exceptions in the repagination did not close the progress
          monitor. 

        * BugFix: InternalFrames did not repaint due to a weird use of the
          RepaintManager in the PreviewProxyBase and some other stupid bugs.

        * BugFix: Non-Embeddable fonts cause no longer fatal errors. If such
          an font is encountered, it will be included as non-embedded font.

        * BugFix: The table targets were completly broken, they have been reworked
          and all direct and indirect causes (aka bad code) was fixed.

        * BugFix: SimpleParser's subbands did not work as expected.

        * BugFix: The export did not show the correct result in the dialogs status
          bar. The synchronisation/locking schema was invalid for all exports. 

        * BugFix: Serialization issues fixed for various functions.
        
        * BugFix: The line-height definition of the TextElementFactory used
          the wrong type causing ClassCastExceptions to be thrown by the
          stylesheet implementation.
        
        * The preview components can now perform multiple exports at the
          same time. Currently 10 parallel exports are possible, this will
          be configurable later.
          
        * The element color function does now work with all bands of an report.
        
        * The TotalItemSumFunction can be used to precompute group results.
        
        * Warning: (ElementVisiblitySwitch function does not work correctly; 
          this will be fixed with version 0.8.5)
          
         
0.8.4-1:
        * BugFix: InternalFrame was not closed properly and caused NullPointers
          in Swing.

        * BugFix: PaintComponentFunctions did draw on a black image. It is now
          transparent instead.

        * BugFix: Band.remove caused exceptions when the band was connected
          with the report.

        * BugFix: Printing values in the GroupFooter caused invalid values to
          be printed, if an PageBreak occured between initializing and printing
          the band.

        * Added Accessor methods for common style properties as suggested
          by 'joecole'. Band and Elements have now various getter/setter
          methods to make the style definition easier.

        * InternalFrameDemo shows how to use the PreviewInternalFrame properly.

0.8.4:
        * Table targets use some kind of repagination to prepare the layouting.
          This makes it possible to compute the columns and styles before they
          are written into the stream, so that we can create streaming content.

        * The BaseFont-Support is now able to cache the collected fonts. This
          reduces the startup time.

        * We have modules to configure the functionality of JFreeReport ...

        * HTML output can strip the file headers to make it easier to include
          the generated content into other files.

        * All code moved to org.jfree.report; all deprecated methods and classes
          were removed. Major structural changes ... (write docs about that issue!)

        * Simple ReportParser creates cleaner objects (undefined attributes are
          no longer filled with unnecessary default values).

        * The SheetName function property is more usable now.

        * The GUI base module contains the option to translate the standard GUI
          dialogs of Swing.

        * The elementfactory package replaces the old ItemFactory. These factory
          classes contain a bean like interface as well as the static methods of
          the old ItemFactory.

        * We now have templates for Rectangles and Horizontal- and Vertical line
          shapes. This reduces the definition code size when creating the common
          shape use-cases.

        * ReportWriter creates slightly cleaner code by removing unnecessary
          class specifications.

	      * SimpleReportParser is now able to create sub bands.

        * The writer supports comments and templates now. Comments are only 
          preserved in extended report formats for now.
         
        * The excel export defines the printer setup according to the report 
          configuration or the defined page format of the report.

        * The reserved-literal (the string that is appended if the text would
          not fit into the element) can now be customized using stylessheets.

        * Initializing JFreeReport is now done in a controled way using the
          Boot class.

        * Minor performance improvements to reduce the number of generated
          objects during the report generation.

        * A graphical configuration editor assists in the process of creating
          JFreeReport configuration files.

        * The XML Parser reports validation errors when a DTD is available.

        * The ReportConverter got a facelifting and can now also be used to
          import the extended reports from older versions. Changed class
          attributes will be translated to the new namespace.

        * The PDF target can now control what PDF document version will be
          generated.
          
0.8.3g:
        * BugFix: XML encoding for entity 'apos' was invalid.

        * BugFix: The call to the AWT print dialog is now completly
          removed from the event-handler thread to work around a
          Java-Bug.

        * BugFix: Exceptions were not logged and caused no valid error
          message when exporting a report with the GUI dialogs.

        * BugFix: ExcelFiles were not visible from the ExcelExportDialog.

        * BugFix: Image- and Shape content was not aligned in the pageable
          output targets.

        * BugFix: Another fix for the image references of the HTML target.
          Images contained in a separate data directory were not visible.

        * BugFix: The multithreading caused problems due to an missing
          sychronize block in the worker class. This caused the worker to
          dead-lock in some cases.

        * BugFix: The preview components did not kill the worker threads
          when being finalized. The repagination worker was not interrupted
          if the pagination was aborted.

        * The Report templates for the reference documentation were not
          included in the JFreeReport jar file.

        * The LayoutManagers now synchronizes on the Element-Tree instead of
          the "this" reference.

        * The PDF layouting bug, which appeared in some VMs has been resolved.
          The bug was caused by an non-strict floating point implementation
          as allowed since Java 1.2; this feature seems to have influence
          on all layouting operations and the PDF generation. The readme file
          contains more details.

0.8.3f: (24-Aug-2003)
        * BugFix: SwingIcons demo definition was invalid.

        * BugFix: The PDF export dialog did not read the predefined
          security settings from the report configuration.

        * BugFix: Table targets did not use the properties to get
          configured.

        * BugFix: The Html Output produced garbage when writing image
          references.

        * BugFix: Expressions were not able to see the next datarow
          and therefore useless as group arguments

        * BugFix: The tabletargets do no longer have a default sheet
          name defined. The html target will no print an automatic
          page header anymore.

        * BugFix: The preview dialog now disables all actions when
          a long running operation is done. The tool bar floating and
          the large icons setting can now be configured from within
          the report properties.

        * The export and pagination progress is now visible in the
          ReportProgressDialog.

0.8.3e: (16-Jul-2003)
        * BugFix: JFreeReportResources didn't work in a Headless environment.
          This caused weird behaviour in Tomcat. Thanks to jxmoshe for your
          valueable hints.

        * BugFix: The Pageable targets created empty pages on
          PageableProcessor.processReport();

        * BugFix: The string encoding 1251 (Windows Cyrillic) was not defined in
          the EncodingComboBox and therefore not visible.

0.8.3d: (29-Jun-2003)
        * BugFix: All table report processors had problems with reports, that
          had a PageFormat with a imagable size > 1000 points. This issue was
          pure stupidity and is fixed now...

        * BugFix: The ItemPercentageFunction did not initialize its private sum
          function properly causing IndexOutOfBounds exceptions.

        * BugFix: The PlainTextOutputTarget did not handle the encodings of the
          generated text, it did encode all texts with "Cp437".

        * BugFix: The PlainTextDialog and the EncodingComboBoxModel had errors
          which prevent them from selecting encodings correctly.

        * BugFix: The StyleSheetCollection now handles stylesheets with the
          same name correctly.

        * All OutputTargets use String properties now for their configuration.
          The object interface was no great idea and caused confusion so it
          was narrowed down to a String-only interface.

          The Strings "true" and "false" are used to express boolean values.

        * The iText library was updated to version 1.00; this version is now
          able to handle the PNG-Alpha channel.

0.8.3c: (19-Jun-2003)
        * BugFix: The Area class is not able to clip lines, any attemp results
          in an empty area. Clipping for lines is now disabled, if the output
          target does not support clipping, the results may look weird if the
          shape exceeds the element bounds.

        * BugFix: The RTF writer does no longer support images. Using images
          seems to cause a memory leak, so this function is disabled until a
          fix is found.

        * BugFix: The ExportDialogs now disables all plugins during the repagination.
          PageSetup works again.

        * BugFix: The demos now report all errors in a proper way.

        * BugFix: The AbstractBandLayoutManager is now able to handle null content
          without crashes.

        * BugFix: The StyleSheet collection now clones all substylesheets correctly
          and gets updated when stylesheets are added or removed from already
          registered stylesheets.

        * The RTF target now supports all fonts by using the PDF base font support
          classes.

        * The StyleSheet collection is available from all Bands and Elements, as
          soon as the element is connected with the report. Independent elements
          have no stylesheet collection.

        * A new PreviewApplet was created to enable the direct preview of
          Reports within a webpage. The OpenSourceDemoApplet demonstrates the
          new component.

0.8.3b:  (16-Jun-2003)
        * BugFix: StyleSheets were not deeply cloned, so inherited stylesheets
          were shared among all reports. This is fixed now.

          Stylesheets can now be accessed directly using StyleSheetCollection,
          which is maintained by the report definition object.

        * BugFix: Printing in the PreviewFrame was no plugin and could not be
          disabled.

        * BugFix: On MacOS X the font path was not detected properly. MacOS
          does not use the standard unix font path.

        * BugFix: Menu accelerators were not defined in a platform independent way.
          Systems without an CTRL key (like MacOS) were not able to use the
          shortcuts).

        * BugFix: Empty pages were not detected correctly, causing empty pages
          to be printed at the end of the report under some circumstances.

          The group footers pagebreak-after-print now works as expected.

        * BugFix: Not all errors which may have occured during the function
          processing were detected or even printed in the log.

        * BugFix: The PlainTextOutputTarget computed wrong page sizes, which
          caused errors when elements were printed at the bottom or the right
          border of a page.

        * BugFix: The TextContent removed leading whitespaces from the text.

        * BugFix: The HTML-TableProcessor did not encode the generated content
          properly. The content was completly invalid and did not conform to any
          standard. The same bug was hidden in the ReportWriter.

          Both classes are working now as expected.

          Warning: UTF-16 encoded content is not readable by Mozilla or IE, both
          browsers are not able to handle standard conforming UTF-16 correctly.

        * BugFix: The report writer is now able to handle inherited stylesheets
          correctly.

        * BugFix: Null values in the element content do no longer cause the layouting
          to fail. NullContent and empty content are handled correctly now.

        * An EmptyReportException is now thrown when the report generation produced
          no pages for the report.

        * The StyleSheet interface is removed now, it was not used.

        * The reference document generator now also generates documentation for the
          DataSource factories.

        * The XML parser now prints the location of the parse error on all exceptions.l

0.8.3a : (04-Jun-2003)
        * BugFix: Serialization works again. All functions are serializable
          now.

        * BugFix: The report writer handles subclasses correctly

        * BugFix: The parser's extended report definition is working again.

        * BugFix: Unclean definitions in the ReportState, Band, Element and
          DataRow classes.

        * BugFix: The excel and PDF target work again.

        * BugFix: Unclean definition in Group and GroupList methods removed.
          Groups can no longer be composed in an invalid way.

        * BugFix: ReportWriter was unclean and did not handle complex stylesheet
          definitions.

        * BugFix: The parser/writer object factories did not handle inherited objects
          correctly in some cases.

        * BugFix: Generating URLs in the ReportParser was unclean.

        * BugFix: ItemColumnQuotientFunction did not implement the function interface
          causing classcast exceptions when used as function.

        * We got a new Swedish translation. All fame goes to Thomas Dilts.

0.8.3    : (26-May-2003)
        * BugFix: The report states where unclean when a pagebreak was issued,
          causing the printing and several computation functions to fail or to
          return invalid values.

          The event oder was redefined to resolve that issue. Please read
          "migration.txt" for details on the new event order.

        * BugFix: URL handling was buggy, the base URL was never set in the
          templates.

        * BugFix: NewLine characters were not handled correctly in the last
          version. After the linebreak was done, an undisplayable newline character
          remained in the text-line instances.

        * BugFix: The repeating group header feature now repeats all marked group
          headers, and not just the last one.

        * BugFix: Wordbreaking was buggy.

        * Most of the parser code moved into JCommon. We are using JCommon version
          0.8.1; all classes of JCommon moved into the package tree under
          org.jfree.*

        * Upgraded to pixie-0.8.0. All pixie classes moved into the package tree
          under org.jfree.*

        * DTD bugs fixed.

        * Modified the BuggyFontRenderer messages as these messages seemed to
          cause confusion.

        * All table output targets (CSV, HTML, Excel, RTF) have now a generic
          configuration interface; the targets can be configured using the
          ReportConfiguration.

        * Drawable elements are officially supported now. There are no
          drawable implementations yet (except JFreeChart :)), more support
          is included in later versions ...

        * ItemColumnQuotientFunction changed into ItemColumnQuotientExpression.

        * New Translations: Slovenian, Russian, Hungarian and Dutch. Adjusted
          the mnemonics of some translations to fit the displayed text.

        * The Excel export now uses the extended data cell style capabilities
          of POI 1.10. Numeric and Date/Time cells are no longer formatted as
          texts, the cells contain numeric values so that you can use them in
          formulas. In case this causes trouble, the cell format strings can
          be redefined or this feature can be completly disabled. Please see
          migration.txt for details.

        * The licence now has an exception for using function and expression
          implementations in non-free programms.

        * Due to several iText improvements, the PDF target is now able to use
          transparent PNG pictures and iText is now able to use all GIF files.

        * The extended XML-Parser and the writer are now able to write and
          parse generic shapes.

        * The report converter GUI now displays exceptions to the user.

0.8.2 : (12-Apr-2003):
        * Important: There were fixes in the shape handling and the order of the
          function events, please read the file migration.txt for detailed
          information about API changes of this release.

        * BugFix: Layouting was broken for band in band stacking and complex layouts.

        * BugFix: SimplePageLayouter layouting was broken.

        * BugFix: The event handling and pagebreaking within the SimplePageLayouter
          was unclean and under some circumstances the row of a last page which
          triggered a pagebreak could got lost.

          The event handling is now in a better defined state: It is guaranteed, that
          page-start events are invoked before any other report event for the page.
          When starting a new report, the page-start event will be the first event that
          is received. When the itemAdvanced event is triggered all previous bands are
          printed completly and no other event is issued between the itemAdvanced and
          the print event (unless the printing would trigger a new pagebreak).

        * BugFix: Images were not printed correctly, when an image was not loaded
          completly using an ImageObserver. The return value of Graphics2D.drawImage
          is now used to determine whether the image must be loaded and reprinted.
          If the image was not yet loaded, the printing process waits until the image
          is completly loaded by the AWT.

        * BugFix: When no content was generated for given bounds, the resulting null
          content was not checked and caused NullPointerExceptions.

        * BugFix: The PlainTextDialog had no CloseListener, so an attemp to close the
          window had no effect.

        * BugFix: TextLayout was buggy, if the minimum size was greater than the
          element's maximum size.

        * BugFix: The template writer was buggy.

        * BugFix: Extended report definition parser had a bug in the handling of
          the extends-tag of stylesheets.

        * BugFix: Several MemoryLeaks have been fixed. The leaks were non-fatal for
          smaller reports but killed report with more than 300 pages. The reference
          to the JFreeReport object within the ReportStates was replaced by a smallscale
          ReportDefinition object.

          The report definition object is readonly and limits access to the bands and
          group definitions and the report configuration. The function/expression
          collections and the tablemodel are no longer directly available within the
          report definition and can only be accessed indirectly by using the DataRow.

        * BugFix: The excel export generated too many CellStyle-definitions. The generated
          excel file could not be read if more than 4000 CellStyles were generated. The
          fixed implementation fixes the caching of previously generated styles.
          The 4000 CellStyles limitation is a hard limit imposed by MS Excel.

        * "shape-element" added for the simple report definition format. The shape
          element can be used to draw shapes retrieved from the dataRow.

        * ShapeFieldTemplate added to create a easy to use "shape-element" for the
          extended report definition profile.

        * The report processing performance is heavily increased.

        * LineShapes were now created correctly when using the ItemFactory.

        * We have an complete french translation of the core libraries now. Thanks
          mimil :)

        * Bands now bind their own BandLayoutManagers.

        * New demo: The card demo has been added to show a complexer use and the power
          of the extended report definition format. The demo uses templates and
          stylesheets to coordinate the appearance of several fields.

          The demo can be found in the package com.jrefinery.report.demo.cards

        * New demo: The PercentageDemo shows the use of NumberFields and the format
          decimal format string of the number field.

        * A new ElementColorFunction defines the color of an element depending on
          a boolean expression.

        * JFreeReport now uses iText 0.98. This iText version is incompatible with
          the previously used iText version 0.96.

        * The available encodings for the various export dialogs can now be defined
          using a properties file. The properties file is referenced in the report
          configuration in the Key "com.jrefinery.report.encodings.available" and
          the key "com.jrefinery.report.encodings.file". The available key
          can be set to "all", "none" or "file".

          A sample encodings property file can be found in the file
          "/com/jrefinery/report/jfreereport-encodings.properties". Disabling
          unnessary encodings will speed up the initial loading of the preview dialogs.

0.8.1_02 : (09-Mar-2003):
        * BugFix: Shape handling was invalid. All Shapes were painted at position
          (0,0) within the element, regardless what was defined for the shape.

        * BugFix: The ReportWriters validity checks were buggy and caused exceptions
          when writting Object-Descriptions.

0.8.1_01 : (04-Mar-2003):
        * BugFix: The PlainTextOutputDialog was not modal and caused trouble.

        * BugFix: Adding element to a band, which already contains that element
          caused IndexOutofBoundsExceptions.

        * BugFix: The extended parser had a bug in the band handler, so that
          elements got added twice.

        * Added stricter error handling to the report processing. This can be
          activated by setting the com.jrefinery.report.StrictErrorHandling
          property to true. If activated, all exceptions that occur during the
          report processing cause the report generation to fail.

        * Removed the "/jfreereport.properties not found" debug message. It caused
          confusion without supplying anything valuable.

        * Updated the HTML OutputTarget so that the default Page text is printed
          properly and Author and Title work as expected. The Html dialog is now
          more resistent against invalid or unexpected inputs.

        * Updated the README file, so that the layout restrictions are mentioned.
          Thanks for the idea, JM Delsaux.

0.8.1 : (28-Feb-2003):
        * BugFix: Corrected many bugs in the SimplePageLayouter.

        * BugFix: empty ReportProperties were not marked correctly.

        * BugFix: TextLine layout was inaccurate, used java.awt.Dimension instead
          of Dimension2D.

        * BugFix: Band containing other bands were not laid out correctly.

        * BugFix: PreviewPane was unusable when used directly. The report was not
          repaginated automaticly and there was no way to trigger the repagination.

        * BugFix: Generated PNG files in the PDFOutputTarget no longer use the
          Alpha-Channel as iText doesn't seem to like it.

        * BugFix: The generated PDF files did not work with GhostScript.

        * BugFix: The ReportFooter handling was unclean and caused trouble.

        * BugFix: The PageBreak was not handled correctly, so that sometimes bands
          got lost after a pagebreak was done.

        * BugFix: Corrected layouting calculations; using double values seem to cause
          incorrect calculations. Switched to float values everywhere.

        * BugFix: BandLayoutManager illegaly modified the values from the
          ElementStyleSheet. This caused invalid states when a band was hidden and restored.

        * BugFix: The PDFOutputTarget did not handle state restoration correctly when a
          new page was started.

        * Refactoring: All tablemodel related classes moved into a spearate package.
          The package is expected to grow heavily during the next releases.

        * Refactoring: The iText font support moved into a separate package. The
          PDFFontFactory is now known as BaseFontFactory.

        * Refactoring: The BandLayout stuff moved into a separate package as these
          classes are used by allmost all output targets.

        * Info: The First demo has been renamed to SwingIconsDemo.

        * Added a main method in the JFreeReport info, so that everybody is able to
          read the library specifications without having to install or start the
          demo package.

        * The order of fields in the group definition does no longer matter. Anyway,
          all fields of the parent group must also be defined in the child group.

        * Added a new event type: The LayoutEvent can be used to adjust INTERNAL values
          after the layouting is completed. Do not use this event to modify the layout,
          this can have funny results, but won't produce what you may expect.

        * Added separate thread for the repagination process and the printing. The
          PageableOutputTarget now check the Thread-state for interrupt events. If
          the current thread gets interrupted, the report processing or repagination
          is canceled.

        * Added resource compare tool lists differences between the base
          resource class and the localized resources to help with the translation
          process.

        * Added a line height property for text elements. This property can be used
          to increase the space between 2 lines.

        * Bands now handle the object composition correctly and check for component
          loops.

        * The ANT script can be used to checkout the latest sources from the anonymous
          CVS repository on sourceforge.

        * Added a generic DummyImplementation for the output targets. This should help
          to reduce the repagination time.

        * We now have a polish translation. Thanks Pjotr (pbzdyl).

        * Font encoding and embedding can now defined separatly for all text elements.

        * The ABSOLUTE_DIM stylekey was removed. This is now handled by specifying
          a minimum size (and a maximum size if needed).

        * Added dynamic element support for all content types. Image and shape elements
          can be defined as dynamic elements to have their sizes adjusted according to
          the contained content.

        * New element template types: ResourceLabel and ResourceField use a string from
          the data source to lookup a value in an assigned ResourceBundle.

        * Added support for Scaling for Shape and Image elements. Scaling can be
          configured to keep the original aspect ratio.

        * The XML parser now uses local copies of the DTD to validate the document,
          if an document type is specified in the XML definitions.

        * Added support for Underlined and StrikeThrough font style.

        * Several new report functions added by Heiko Evermann.

        * A PaintComponentFunction can be used to create Images from AWT-Components.

        * Added PaintComponentFunction to create images from AWT or Swing components.
          The generated images can be used in ImageElements.

        * Added a new Demo: OpenSourceDemo2.java

        * The maximum band height is now limited by the page height. A band will never
          grow over the available page size when using dynamic elements. To make a band
          greater than the available page height, the user has to force it by defining
          such an invalid minimum band size. This fix reduces the accidentaly generated
          "Report-Does-Not-Proceed" Exceptions.

        * Added a new Demo: LGPLDemo.java shows the automatic height limitation for oversized
          "dynamic" elements.

        * Heiko Evermann wrote an Excel-OutputTarget, which provided the base implementation
          for several table style output targets:

          Added several new OutputTargets:

          - Simple XML Output
              an educational output target to have a simple output target
          - CSV Data-Output
              to write the raw data from the DataRow into a CSV file
          - CSV TableLayout Output
              writes layouted bands and elements into a CSV file.
          - Excel Output
              writes Excel files using the Apache POI library.
          - HTML Output
              writes HTML4 and XHTML content.
          - RTF Output
              generates simple RTF documents
              (implementation limited to standard fonts)
          - PlainTextOutput
              generates text files

        * Added a new XML-parser to support extended report definitions.
          Also implemented a writer to create XML-Definitions from JFreeReport objects.
          The new parser can be used transparent replacement of the old implementation,
          without any special treatment of the client application. The report definition
          type is detected during the parsing process.

        * Added a report converter to convert reports from the simple profile into
          the extensible report definition format.
          (com.jrefinery.report.io.ext.writer.ReportConverterGUI)

        * Added a ReferenceDoc generator for the extensible report definition format:
          (com.jrefinery.report.io.ext.ReferenceDocGenerator)

        * Added support for templates to simplify the usage of DataSources and DataFilters.

        * Redesigned the PreviewDialogs: All dialog implementations now share a common
          backend. All Export-Targets are included using a PlugIn-Strucure and can
          be activated and deactivated separatly using the ReportConfiguration.

        * BugFix: Cloning was insufficient to separate functions and expression from their
          anchestors. Added the method getInstance() to enforce a strict separation of
          the original expression instance and the generated copy.

        * Added a second properties file ("/jfreereport.properties") which overlays the
          main property file "com/jrefinery/report/jfreereport.properties". Use this file
          to create a global configuration without having to repack the jfreereport.jar file.

        * The FileEncodings are now selectable from the PDF- and HTML dialogs.

        * Patrice Rolland contributed a french translation

0.8.0-3 : (07-Jan-2003):
        * BugFix: Fixed the ReportStateList. Element were added at the wrong position, causing
          NullPointerExceptions. Also fixed the dynamic element, if the element contained too much
          data which would not fit on a single page, the report generation failed. Now the data
          is cut down to the size of a single page. The LGPL-Demo shows the new behaviour.

0.8.0-2 : (19-Dec-2002):
        * BugFix: fix for a ReportFooter bug in the layoutmanagement. Printing the ReportFooter on
          its own page caused the report generation to fail.

0.8.0-1 : (16-Dec-2002):
        * BugFix: fix for a PageHeader bug in the layoutmanagement. The bug
          caused the pageheader to drive crazy and print strange values in the elements.

0.8.0 : (13-Dec-2002):
        * Many, many ... (repeat it several times: many) ... many lines of JavaDoc documentation.

        * Added a new Demo: StraightToPDF.java: Demo for saving PDF directly - no preview

        * Added a new Demo: HelloWorld.java: New (simple) demo.

        * Added a new Demo: OpenSourceProjects.java

        * BugFix: FontRendering is not correct when not using AntiAliasing on some JDKs.
          A configuration setting exists to switch to an alterate font size calculation

        * BugFix: PDFFontFactory did not prevent iText from caching the created fonts -> OutOfMemoryException

        * BugFix: PDFDocument metadata was never added to the document (Author and Title)

        * BugFix: original LineBreaking was buggy and got fixed by Aleksandr Gekht

        * BugFix: DefaultTableModel creation was buggy, ReportGenerator had a NullPointer
          on parseReport(File). Thanks to Robert Fuller for the report and the fix.

        * FunctionLeveling: functions can be executed in a controled order. Functions of the same
          depencylevel are considered independent, functions with a higher level depended.

        * Dynamic TextElements are now fully supported.

        * A full featured configuration interface with support for external property file
          and system-properties added. Reports can supply local configuration settings
          (as PDFEncoding or advanced PDF-Settings (security, author, title)

        * ReportProperties can be defined in the report definition. <property-ref> tag
          is used to mark and possibly define the property. Marked properties are treated
          as DataRow-columns and can be queried as every other function or tablemodel column.

        * PageCounting can now be customized. Start-page can be set, page counting is now
          a Function.

        * Preview frame can have a maximum-size and a preferred-size defined. The maximum
          size is enforced.

        * Logging now uses Object-parameters instead of strings for performance reasons.

        * A PreviewDialog was added, as frames are not accessible from within modal
          dialogs.

        * PreviewDialog/Frame menus changed to allow the selection of Zoom-levels by
          using the JMenu.

        * Some possible memory leaks have been resolved. Most leaks occur in certain
          Swing/AWT environments when PreviewFrames and ReportPanes are not garbage collected.
          If you think you found another leak, report it to us (and don't forget to
          tell us the JDK version you use).

        * We have a polish translation. And there is a spanish translation as well.

        * Elements can have a vertical alignment.

        * LineShapeElement changed. A line is no longer extended to the full width
          if the X values are equal and the Y values are equal. A line must be  a
          valid shape and can then be extended to the full element dimension by
          setting the scale-property to true.

        * All Bands are able to pagebreak before or after printing. Pagebreaks on
          empty pages are ignored. A page is empty if no content or just the pageheader
          is printed.

        * All text is now printed to the font's base line. The base line is calculated
          manually and does not depend on the AWT anymore. Now the results are almost
          as accurate as the iText calculations.

        * The report now uses a new layouting/printing subsystem. Printing is done by
          using a report function and is no longer bound to a specific output method.

        * The dynamic feature finally works in all imaginable configurations.

        * Elements are now configured using StyleSheets. There is no direct StyleSheet
          support in the parser yet. StyleSheet can inherit settings from other
          style sheets. Not all stylesheet settings are configurable using the classical
          get/set methods and not all style-settings need to be used by the outputtargets.
          StyleSheet-settings should be seen as a general constraints collection, and
          like AWT does, not every constraint is used everywhere.

        * The PDF-Dialog is now able to save the PDF without showing the dialog to the
          user.

        * Bands are able to use LayoutManager for their internal component layout.
          Bands can be stacked into each other, the same rules as in the AWT apply.

        * The report state list uses a smarter storage model. The first states are
          now always stored as strong-references.

        * JCommon-0.7.1 is used.

        * removed deprecated classes and most of the deprecated functions. <*-function>
          tags are no longer defined in the DTD, use the corresponding <*-field> elements.
          DataElement and DataFunctionElement and their sub classes do no longer exist.
          Use text fields and filters instead or create similiar fields using the ItemFactory.

        * PageCountFunction and PageTotalFunction is now more flexible and can count
          the pages of a certain group or can start counting at an arbitary page number.

        * Functions and Expressions have dependency levels.  Higher dependency functions
          are executed before lower dependency functions.

        * There is a JPEG-Servlet in the extension package. This servlet generates
          JPEG-Files for every page of an report.

0.7.6 : (07-Sep-2002):

        --- A new Library is needed: bsh.jar from www.beanshell.org ---

        * Downport to JDK 1.2.2, requires a Pixie-Update from the CVS; JFreeReport should
          now work in Visual Age for Java 3.5 without any patching.

        * PDF supports security and encryption (40bit & 128bit keys). The password for the example
          is "user" and "owner" for the user- and the ownerpassword.

        * An extended and more comportable Save-Dialog for PDF-Files exists

        * Expressions exist as a way to implement stateless lightweight
          functions. Expressions do not maintain a state and refer only
          the current datarow.

        * The BSHExpression can be used to include the expressions sourcecode
          in the report definition. This enables a

        * DataRows are used to unify the access to the different datasources
          as functions, expressions and the tablemodel.

        * Bands can be set invisible, invisible bands are not printed and
          consume no space.

        * Band height of "-100" is now interpreted as "full page height available".
          In the XML-definitions this can be expressed by setting the pageheight to "100%"

        * Rectangle-Elements support drawing, so that an unfilled border can
          be drawn

        * After Parsing the report the source filename and the contentbase
          are stored as report properties.

        * The DefaultPageFormat can be defined in the report definitions <report>-tag

        * All Strings are cut down to the length of the element. If a string is too
          long to fit into the field, the string is cut down on word boundry.

        * Bug: PreviewFrame was not being GarbageCollected, if dispose() or removeNotify() was
          not called. Added call to dispose when the frame is hidden.

        * Bug: Drawing on G2OutputTarget was buggy, aligment was inaccurate

        * Bug: FontSize for G2OutputTarget was not calculated correctly

        * Bug: ReportPane.setError was buggy

        * Bug: ReportState.isProceeding was useless

        * Bug: Fonthandling for default fonts fixed in PDF-Target

        * Bug: Unicode support was not working in PDF-mode

        * Bug: some GIF Images not recognized

        * Bug: ClassLoader changed for use in servlet environment

        * Bug: Mutiline-Text fixed

        * Bug: Cloning fixed

        * Bug: An Empty (0 rows) tablemodel caused a single all-elements-null row to be printed. Fixed,
          now the headers and then the footers are printed without an ItemBand between headers and footers
          in that case.

        * Bug: WMF-Support in Pixie-Lib: The WmfImageProducer needed a huge amount of RAM to work on
          complex images, now the image production process uses multiple scanlines to create the image
          resulting in lower resource usage.

0.7.5 : (21-Jul-2002):
        * DTD updated to contain the latest elements

        * Bug: ReportFunctions are now evaluated before the result is printed

        * Bug: WaitingImageObserver deadlock fixed

        * Bug: Nullpointers on empty graphic fixed

        * Bug: Corrected function behaviour when the tablemodel contains no data

        * Bug: Reportproperties set in the JFreeReport object got lost when a report is started

        * A new example (first.xml) which is used in the documentation

        * Most classes now implement the serializable and clonable interfaces

        * TextElement simplified

        * ImageElement/ImageFunctionElement updated

        * Removed JUNIT tests from base package. The tests can be found in
          the extension project.

        * A new mode exists on report processing, called a prepare run. During this run,
          the report is repaginated and the reentry points for the ReportStateList are
          created. Function-results computed in this state can be reused during the real
          report processing. This leads to 2 new functions to demonstrate the posibilities:

        * 2 new functions ItemPercent and TotalSum
          TotalSum summarizes a group in the prepare run so that the total sum
          for that group is available in the group header.

0.7.4 : (10-Jun-2002):
        * A bug in PDFFontFactory crashed the programm in linux

        * jcommon-0.6.2.jar is now included in the package. JCommon
          changed the name of an used class, so you have to use jcommon-0.6.2
          instead of one of the previous versions.

0.7.3 : (09-Jun-2002):
        * PreviewPane has a property to enable/disable the painting of the
          border

        * PreviewFrame's toolbar floating is controled by a property

        * PDFTarget uses the truetype fonts of the system. These fonts have
          to be registered to the FontFactory in order to be used.
          Registration can be done by feeding Directories or files into the
          PDFOutoutTarget.FontFactory or by letting the factory search the
          fonts by ifself by setting the SystemProperty
          "com.jrefinery.report.targets.PDFOutputTarget.AUTOINIT" to "true"

        * PDFTarget is able to do unicode. The encoding is controled by the
          system property
          "com.jrefinery.report.targets.PDFOutputTarget.ENCODING"
          and defaults to windows "Cp1252" (WinANSI). Set this property to
          "Identity-H" to enable HorizontalUnicode writing (see
          PDFOutputTarget.setEncoding() and the iText documentation for more
          information on that)

        * PreviewFrame has improved navigation (Goto first, last, or Page#)

        * A statusbar for the PreviewPane displays total and current pages

        * A demo with 200.000 rows is added to show what JFR is able to do

        * Truetype-Fonts are now embedded in PDF

        * Support for generic shapes is included

        * a new Element (RectangleShapeElement) for filled colored boxes

        * all TextElement-Inheritants have been replaced by the filtering
          interface in com.jrefinery.report.filter. The deprecated classes in
          the main package should no longer be used. Use the ItemFactory to
          create the TextElement with correct filters attached.

        * A new function (ElementVisibilitySwitch) shows how to control the
          visiblity of elements at runtime.

        * The parser has a better structure and can be easier customized
          using inheritance.

        * All TextElements are now able to perform a linebreak if the text
          is too long to fit on the line and if there is space for more than
          one line.

        * Reports are repaginated before printing, Repagination moved into
          JFreeReport. A new ReportState property (isPrepareRun()) can be
          used to query whether this is a repagination run.

        * The total number of pages is stored in the report properties
          (using key "report.pagecount")

        * An exception dialog informs the user when errors occur. A stacktrace
          can be viewed in this dialog if wanted.

        * ReportProperties are now bound to the ReportStates, not the report,
          and shared among all ReportStates derived from the StartState.
          A repagination run for printing/saving will no longer affect other
          prepared reports.

        * UI improvements

        * removed ReportStateConstants interface and the constants for the
          action commands in JFreeReportConstants.

        * All classes have at least basic documentation.

        * All UserInterface strings are localized. Localisations for
          english and german exist.


        Bugs fixed:
        * ReportState did not initialize the ReportProperties correctly

        * ReportState caused a OutOfMemoryError on huge reports

        * the default PageFormat is passed from the JFreeReport-object into the
          PreviewFrame.

        Still to do:

        * JUnitTests

0.7.2a: (15-May-2002) Just a small fix as long as the code is fresh.
        * No more NullPointer if the DataModel contains null
        * values. Functions can no longer disrupt the report processing by
          throwing Exceptions.
        * All text elements have a property "nullstring" to define a String
          which will replace all Null-Values for this element's or function's
          value. Thanks go to Thomas Rynne for this inspiration.
        * Fixed Bug: The ImageReference did not fill its sourceURL, so printing
          images to pdf targets always failed.

0.7.2 : (14_May-2002) This release is the result of a code review. Most
        classes have been simplified and hardened. Unnessecary import
        statements have been removed, so every class has changed. Please
        look at the classes ChangeLog to see real changes.

        * Important: Please make sure you have the Pixie-Library included,
          or ImageReference/ImageElement will not work. The Pixie-Library
          is included in JFreeReport's repositiory and release directory.

        * All complex constructors have been removed. For every element
          exists a defaultConstructor. All properties can be accessed by
          accessor functions.

        * From now on a report is always completly initialized. Such a
          report has no null-value bands or groups. A report is guaranteed
          to have at least one group.

        * Groups have to be fully qualified. A sub-group has to include all
          fields from its parent. So if you define group "Continents" and
          a subgroup of "Countries" you have to declare

          <groups>
            <group name="Continents">
              <fields>
                <field>Continient</field>
              </fields>
            </group>
            <group name="Countries">
              <fields>
                <field>Continient</field>
                <field>Countries</field>
              </field>
            </group>
          </groups>

         for the report to work correctly. See example2.xml for a complete
         report definition.

       * ReportHeader, ReportFooter and GroupHeaders may trigger a pageBreak
         before they are printed.
         See example3.xml for details.

       * Line-Elements now recognize the colors-attribute.

       * PreviewPane has been moved to its own package. The actions
         now are abstract to ease up integration of the preview pane in
         other programms.

       * ReportState is much smarter now. Transition from a state to another
         is now done by returning a instance of ReportState, which handles
         all state specific actions.

       * The function interface has been improved. All function get references
         to the report definition and the current report state.

       * Bugfixes:

         - LastRowMissingBug reported by Steven Feinstein is fixed
         - Multiple data elements can now be added to a band refering to
           the same table model column
         - no more NullPointer if no ItemBand or no group defined.

0.7.1 : (24-Apr-2002) A DTD exists for the default report parser, support
        for images, multilined text, and some updates to the PreviewFrame.
        JFreeReport includes a modified version of Pixie to support the
        wmf-file format.

0.7.0 : (8-Mar-2002) Reports can now be saved to PDF format using the
        iText PDF generator (http://www.lowagie.com/itext/).
        Integrated code contributed by Thomas Morgner including report
        functions, XML report definitions and various bug fixes.
        JFreeReport no longer user ANTLR-parsed report definitions.

0.6.0 : (8-Feb-2002) A minor update to ensure compatibility with the
        JCommon Class Library.

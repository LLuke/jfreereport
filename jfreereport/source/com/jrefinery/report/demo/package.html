Classes making up the demonstration application for the JFreeReport Class Library.
You will need the icons and report definitions in the classpath. Also make sure that you
have an JAXP-Compatible XML-Parser included in your classpath.
<p>
To start the demo, use com.jrefinery.report.demo.JFreeReportDemo as mainclass. To start
a special version of the demo with really huge reports, try to start
com.jrefinery.report.demo.HugeJFreeReportDemo. But be patient, the reports 5 and 6 there
have several thousand records. It will take time to perform the reporting.

Classes for reading XML-based report definitions. The parser is able to ues all features
of JFreeReport 0.7.2 and most features or 0.7.3.
<p>
The DTD for the reportdefinition files can be found at
<a href="http://jfreereport.sourceforge.net/report.dtd">http://jfreereport.sourceforge.net/report.dtd</a>
or in the distribution package.
<p>
This parser uses deprecated element classes. These classes will get not extension
for new features and as soon as the discrepancy beween implemented and possible features
gets too huge, this parser will be discontinued and a new implementation will be started.
<p>
After this point no new features are added to the old parser, and the parser will remain active
for the sake of compatibility.

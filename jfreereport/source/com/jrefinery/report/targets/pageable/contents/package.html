Report contents. Contents are abstract views of the data that should be printed
in the OutputTarget. There are 3 known types of content yet: Text, Shapes and Images.
The abstract view allows the logical page to format the content without knowing any
details about the content itself.

Content may be split into several parts, so that portions of content for specific bounds
can be extracted.

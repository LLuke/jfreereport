Some rules when working with the report definition objects:
<ul>
<li>Functions cannot be added to the report once the report generation has
started.
<li>Do not modify the report structure after the report
generation is started, unless you know exactly what you are doing.
<li>It is safe to modify the report definition <b>before</b> the report is
started.
<li>Once the report processing has started, the report from the report
processor must not be reused for other purposes.
</ul>

RTF file output, using iText.
<p>
This package is no final version.  iText does not support RTF very well,
so this target will be ported to an different RTF writer in a later version.
<p>
At the moment, the rtf output does not support ROWSPANning  of cells or
FONTs other than the standard fonts Serif, SansSerif or Courier.
<p>
This package is not enabled by default and not included in the preview frame.
There will be no support for bug in this package.
<p>
The current implementation is not suited for huge documents, as the whole document
is held in memory until the complete table was created. This implementation will
be fixed in the future.

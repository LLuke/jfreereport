Common base classes for the table style output targets.
</p>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>
The TableExports add several restrictions to the report layouts.
</p>
<p>
Report elements must not overlay each other. It is ok for bands,
but the actual data must never overlap. Once a cell is occupied,
it cannot be redefined to contain data from other elements.
CellData cannot be combined.
</p>
<p>
Backgrounds can only be defined for the complete cell.
</p>
<h3>How does the table export work?</h3>
<p>
All table targets use a two step process to create the output. In
the first step, the layout is computed and styles information is collected.
The style information will later be reused to form cascading stylesheets
or to fill the Excel style tables.
</p>
<p>
The public interface to perform a table export is contained in the
class TableProcessor and their derived classes. Users will not have to
worry about the internal details of the export process itself.
</p>
<p>
The usual report event sequence will trigger events on the TableWriter
implementation. This implementation will perform the necessary global layout
and generates the MetaElements, which represent an output target dependent
layout result.
</p>
<p>
These MetaElements get forwared to an attached TableCreator, which either
collects the table grid information or which uses previously collected
grid data to finally build the output. The TableProcessor implementation
is free to allow more than two process levels.
</p>
<p>
To define cell background, implementations must use the class TableCellBackground
as base class.
</p>
<h2>How to implement table targets</h2>
<p>
TableTarget implementors have to provide at least a suitable MetaBandProducer
and a tablecontent creator.

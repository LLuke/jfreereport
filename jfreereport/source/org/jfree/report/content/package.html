Report contents. Contents are abstract views of the data that should be printed
in the OutputTarget. There are 3 known types of content yet: Text, Shapes and Images.
The abstract view allows the logical page to format the content without knowing any
details about the content itself.
<p>
Content may be split into several parts, so that portions of content for specific bounds
can be extracted.
<p>
To create contents, an LayoutSupport defines a ContentFactory. This factory is resopnsible
to create the content from the Element's value, if the OutputTarget does support the elements
content type.
<p>
<h3>How content is created and used within the report processing</h3>
<ul>
<li>The ContentFactory is used to create the content for the elements.
The elements <code>getValue()</code> method is used to read the assigned content
for the element. This raw data and the elements style definition is used to create
the content. When using the <code>DefaultContentFactory</code>, the content is created
using one of the defined <code>ContentFactoryModules</code>.
<li>The Content is then used to compute the size for the <i>dynamic</i> elements by
the <code>BandLayoutManager</code>.
<li><b>PageableLayout:</b>
Once the layout is complete, the content is used in the logical page to create
the required <code>PhysicalOperation</code>s needed to display the content in the
<code>OutputTarget</code>. This conversion is done by one of the <code>OperationModule</code>s
of the OutputTargets or LogicalPages <code>OperationFactory</code>.
<li>The generated PhysicalOperations are added to the physical page and finally printed
when the physical page is closed.
</ul>

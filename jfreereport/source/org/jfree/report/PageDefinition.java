 * A logical page definition for a report.
 * <p>
 * Page oriented reports use the page definition to distribute the content of
 * one logical page to the physical pages. The order of the physical pages in the
 * page definition defines the content order in the generated documents.
 * <p>
 * If a logical page is completly empty, it will be removed from the report and
 * a pageCanceled event is fired. If a physical page within a non empty logical
 * page is empty, if depends on the ReportProcessor whether the page is printed
 * as empty page or whether it will be removed from the report.
 * <p>
 * Areas of the logical page not covered by the physical pages will not cause
 * errors, the content in these areas will be ignored and not printed.
 * <p>
 * In JFreeReport 0.8.5 support for more than one phsyical page in the page
 * definition is untested, unsupported and will not work as expected. This feature
 * needs some more work.
 * <p>
 * Page definitions must not be changed during the report processing, or funny
 * things may happen.

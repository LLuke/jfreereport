The OSCache version contained in this directory has been patched to work with
the good old JDK 1.2.2. There is no reason to use one of the newer releases,
as all the new additions there only increase the code size without adding any
real value.

This build contains all the features of the original OSCache, except for the
JGroups clustering support. The JGroups implementation does not uphold to the
tradition and uses JDK 1.4. So it had to be removed.

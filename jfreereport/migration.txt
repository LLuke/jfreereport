Migrating from version 0.7.6 to 0.8.0

If you are using the XML-Definition and the predefined PreviewDialogs only,
you can skip the code changes, your reporting process has not changed.

XML-Definition and changes in the reporting behaviour

- Bands now contain all elements defined for band, the bands height
  is altered to fit the elements. The predefined height set via setHeight()
  is now a minimumHeight

- Proportional values are evaluated by calculating the band size used by
  static (non-proportional elements). Then the dimensions of all elements are
  calculated, and the final band dimension defined.

  This dimension is finally applied to the proportional values a second time,
  and the elements are drawn.

  It can cause problems if you ignore the 100% size of those relative elements,
  so f.i. an element at position 90% and a height of > %10 could cause trouble.
  Trouble means, that your layout looks a little bit weird within that band,
  and that that invalid element is not printed properly.

- All text elements have now vertical alignment (as implemented in the last cvs
  version), bands can define default values for ElementAlignments.

- GroupHeader can be repeated after an pagebreak. The last groupheader that is marked
  as repeatable is repeated. If the groupheader + pageheader + pagefooter does not
  fit on the current page, you get State-did-not-proceed errors.

- The pagefooter can now contain dynamic elements.

- and Finally: The Dynamic Elements work now! Real and tested! 

Code Changes

- all deprecated elements have been removed. Now there are only
  3 elements left: ImageElement, ShapeElement, TextElement

- as usual: elements should be created with the ItemFactory.

- Elements store their attributes in StyleSheets.

  The StyleSheet is accessible via Element.getStyle()
  and can be queried via Element.getStyle().getStlyeProperty(StyleKey);

  StyleKeys are defined in the class ElementStyleSheet for Elements and Bands
  and BandStyleSheet for Bands only.

- Element bounds have now a different meaning. Bounds are defined
  by setting the StyleKey ABS_DIMENSION and ABS_POSITION.
  ABS_DIMENSION is of type Dimension2D. To specify a float dimension
  you could use com.jrefinery.report.targets.FloatDimension
  ABS_POSITION is of type Point2D.

- StyleKey BOUNDS is used internaly during the layouting.

- the class JFreeReport is no longer used to repaginate the report or to
  start processing of an report, use the PageableReportProcessor instead.

  Instead of calling JFreeReport.processReport() you should now use this code:

   // report created elsewhere
   // the outputtarget must be opened

      PageableReportProcessor proc = new PageableReportProcessor(report);
      proc.setOutputTarget(target);
      proc.processReport();

   // don't forget to close the outputtarget ..

Changes from 0.8.0 to 0.8.1

  The PDFFontFactory is now relocated to an own package. All classes can now
  be found in com.jrefinery.report.targets.support.PDFFontFactory.

  The band layout management has moved to com.jrefinery.report.targets.base.**.

  The "first" demo has been renamed to "swing-icons-demo" to better fit is purpose
  in the documentation, as it is no longer the simplest demo available.

  The layouting now handles the element font defintion correctly. If an element's
  height is smaller than the defined font size, then no line will be printed. So
  if your elements disappear after upgrading, then check your element definitions. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from 0.8.1 to 0.8.2

Shapes:
  The shape content handling was buggy. Shape bounds are specified relative
  to the element bounds.

  In previous versions, both the shape bounds and the element bounds were defined equal.
  So a line starting on y=10 within the band had the shape element bounds with y=10
  and contained a line2D shape with y1=10 and y2=10. The shape was later transformed
  to y=0 before painting. This way all shapes were translated to x=0,y=0, regardless
  of their real bounds. That invalid behaviour is fixed now, but all shape definitions
  have changed.

  This bug only affects the ext-definition styles, as the simple parser profile
  adjusts the shapes within the predefined shape elements automaticly. To fix your
  extended-definition, either adjust your shape definition to start at position 0,0
  or adjust your element to start at 0,0 and extend its dimension to
  (old_x + old_width, old_y + old_height).

-----------------
1.  INTRODUCTION
-----------------
JFreeReport is an open-source Java class library for generating
reports.  It runs on the Java 2 Platform (JDK1.3 or later).

JFreeReport is licensed, free of charge, under the terms of the GNU
Lesser General Public Licence (LGPL).  A copy of the licence is
included in the download.

Please note that JFreeReport is distributed WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY;
without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  Please refer refer to the licence for details.

-------------------
2.  LATEST VERSION
-------------------
The latest version of this class library can be obtained from:

    http://www.object-refinery.com/jfreereport

If you have an comments, suggestions or bugs to report, please post a
message in the JFreeReport discussion forum.

-----------------
3.  DEPENDENCIES
-----------------
JFreeReport requires JDK 1.3 or later.  

JFreeReport uses classes from the JCommon class library (also available from
http://www.object-refinery.com), version 0.5.6 or later.  The JCommon
jar file is included in the JFreeReport download, but you may want to
download JCommon separately to obtain the full source code (also under
the GNU Lesser General Public Licence).

JFreeReport uses icons from the Java Look and Feel Graphics Repository
that are the copyright of Sun Microsystems, Inc.  See the icons
directory for details.

JFreeReport uses the open source iText library to create reports in Acrobat PDF
format.  You can download the latest version of iText from 
http://www.lowagie.com/iText/index.html 

Finally, JFreeReport requires a SAX parser to read report definition
files.  Any JAXP1.1 parser should work - Xerces
(http://xml.apache.org) is a good choice, but we've included the jar
file from the GNU JAXP project
(http://www.gnu.org/software/classpathx/jaxp/) because of its size.
The licence is GPL with a "library exception".


------------------------
4. THE DEMO APPLICATION
------------------------
There is a demonstration application included with JFreeReport.  To run
it you need the files jfreereport-0.7.0.jar, jcommon-0.5.6.jar,
iText.jar and gnujaxp.jar.  In addition the files report1.xml and
report2.xml must be on your classpath.

Using JDK 1.3 (or later) you can start the demo by running the class:

    com.jrefinery.report.demo.JFreeReportDemo.

For example, on Linux, the following command line will run the demo
application (when the current working directory is
jfreereport-0.7.0/jars):

java -classpath .:jcommon-0.5.6.jar:jfreereport-0.7.0.jar:iText.jar:gnujaxp.jar com.jrefinery.chart.demo.JFreeReportDemo

Depending on your system configuration and the current working
directory, you may need to specify different paths in the above
command line.  

Windows users should separate entries in the classpath
with a semi-colon, not a colon.

Note that the demo application looks for the files report1.xml and
report2.xml on the classpath.  These files contain sample report
definitions.

Crosstab-Component:

<cross-tab dimension-strategy>
  <dimension name="Dimension1" placement="left">
    <!-- Header cell definition here -->
  </dimension>
  <dimension name="Dimension2" placement="left">
    <!-- Header cell definition here -->
  </dimension>
  <dimension name="Dimension3" placement="top">
    <header>
    <!-- Header cell definition here -->
    </header>
    <total>
      asasd
    </total>
  </dimension>
  <dimension name="Dimension4" placement="top">
    <!-- Header cell definition here -->
  </dimension>
  <data>
    <!-- Data cell definition here -->
  </data>
</cross-tab>

  The order of the dimensions on the axis is important (so left, right affect
  each other and top-bottom affect each other). The dimension that is declared
  first is the outer dimension.

  The data cell is always the last one ..

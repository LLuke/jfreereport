-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To be implemented before the release is ready:
* Redesign the dialogs to follow the common usability guides                     (3 days)
* Verify the PlainText-Output target       (2 days)
* Update the ANT script to reflect the new modules.
* The report writer is not producing legal results. 

What will be impossible:
* The 'keep-together' feature is not implementable with the old engine.
* Pagebreaks within bands - this needs a fundamental change, which is breeding 
  in the 'libLayout' subproject.
* Subreports - once again the old engine would die while trying to solve that 
  problem 

Next minor release:
* Add support for rotated text             (?)
* Verify the page-spanning printing        (? > 3 days)

Known bugs:
* Non-Area shapes, which are not instances of Line2D cannot be
  drawn right now. The clipping fails for these shapes. [Not fixable yet]

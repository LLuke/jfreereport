The licence exceptions in this file apply to all past and future versions
of JFreeReport. Part 1 grants the rights to use JFreeReport in non-free
programs and libraries without having to worry about accidentialy creating
a derived work. This just describes that we want to have the LGPL applied
exactly in the same way as every C programmer is able to do.
Part 2 allows everyone to implement own Functions and
Expressions without the need to make them LGPLed.

Part 1: Permission to link JFreeReport using the Java Linking Mechanism

This file contains some exceptions to the LGPL for the JFreeReport
source code. The exception grants you the right to write own functions
or expressions without causing your program to fall under the terms
of the GNU Lesser General Public Licence.

We consider linking JFreeReport into other programs to be non-viral.
As until today (Feb-2004) it is still not clear whether calling java
functions and objects from non-free code is linking or (due to the
special nature of the java linking system) whether this creates a
derivate work, we therefore grant everyone the right to link their
programms to all JFreeReport classes using Java linking mechanisms,
without causing the whole work to fall under the terms of the GNU
Lesser General Public License.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part 2: Permission to create derived Functions and Expressions

As a special exception, the copyright holders of JFreeReport give you
permission to extend JFreeReport with modules that implement the
"org.jfree.report.function.Expression" or the
"org.jfree.report.function.Function" interface, regardless
of the license terms of these implementations, and to copy and distribute the
resulting combined work under terms of your choice, provided that
every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a complete copy of
the source code of JFreeReport (the version of JFreeReport used to produce the
combined work), being distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser
General Public License plus this exception.

This exception applies to the Java interfaces "Expression" and "Function"
and the classes "AbstractExpression" and "AbstractFunction" of the package
"org.jfree.report.function".

Note that people who make modified versions of JFreeReport are not obligated
to grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is
their choice whether to do so.  The GNU Lesser General Public License gives
permission to release a modified version without this exception; this
exception also makes it possible to release a modified version which
carries forward this exception.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
As the FSF finally cleared all doubts on whether the LGPL is compatible
with the java linking system, this exception is no longer required.

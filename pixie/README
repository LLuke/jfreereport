1.  INTRODUCTION
-----------------
Pixie is a WMF-File reading library originally written by David R. Harris as
converter for the Pixie-ImageViewer. Pixie was long time dead and is now
resurrected as WMF-Reader and ImageProducer for Java 1.2.2 or higher.

Pixie lacks the support for most BitMap-Formats but everything else is working
fine. Write-Support will be implemented somewhere in the future, classes
for the writesupport are mostly dummies at the moment.

Pixie is licensed, free of charge, under the terms of the GNU Lesser
General Public Licence.  A copy of the licence is included in the download.

The latest version of this class library can be obtained from:

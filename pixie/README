Pixie is a WMF-File reading library originally written by David R. Harris as
converter for the Pixie-ImageViewer. Pixie was long time dead and is currently
resurrected as WMF-Reader and ImageProducer for Java 1.2.2 or higher.

Pixie lacks the support for most BitMap-Formats but everything else is working
fine. Write-Support is beeing implemented somewhere in the near future.


WARNING: Pixie moved from package gnu.bhresearch.pixie to the package
         org.jfree.pixie
         
         Additionally we removed all leftovers from the original pixie
         library, so that only the WMF file format is supported.

04-Mar-2005 : Another BugFix release for JFreeReport 0.8.5;
              The classes from package org.jfree.pixie.g2recorder are no longer
			  included in the release, until they have been completed.

21-Oct-2004 : BugFixes ..

19-Jan-2004 : Some final changes and discontinued for now. Implementing the writing
              support seems useless in a free world, where SVG is available. Some minor
              fixes were made in the WMF-Reading, it is still not complete (and as there
              is no useable documentation available, I doubt it ever will be complete).

              Use SVG instead. 

29-Aug-2002 : Downport to JDK1.2.2 : Altered WmfImageProducer to use less
              memory on producing.

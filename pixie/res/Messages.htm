<H1>Pixie Warning and Error Messages</H1>

This page lists the main error and warning messages produced by the Pixie
system. They may help you diagnose any problems. 
If you need to contact <A HREF="Support.htm">Support</A>, you will probably be asked for the
full text of any messages that appear.

<A NAME="ConvPxi"></A>
<H4>ConvPxi error messages
</H4><UL><P>
Here are the main error messages ConvPxi may produce.
You will see one of these if there is some problem that stops
PixiConv producing a .PXI file.
<DL>
	<DT><P>Usage: <I>string</I><DD>
		ConvPxi did not understand the commandline parameters
		it found. The <I>string</I> tries to explain what it was
		expecting.
	<DT>NumberFormat: <I>string</I><DD>
		ConvPxi was expecting a number (for example, 600), and
		didn't understand what it found.
	<DT>FileNotFound: <I>filename</I><DD>
		ConvPxi could not open the given filename.
		Perhaps it is misspelt, or in a different directory or folder.
		This can also be reported for output files which are not writable.
	<DT>Error: Input and output must be different<DD>
		You specified the same name for both the input file
		and the output file. ConvPxi cannot cope with that.
	<DT>Error: Don't know how to convert <I>filename</I><DD>
		<I>Filename</I> is not a Windows Metafile or a Pixie script
		file, and ConvPxi doesn't know what to do with it.
	<DT>Error: <I>filename</I> is not a real metafile<DD>
		Although <I>filename</I> looks like a Windows Metafile
		at first sight (for example, it probably has the .WMF extension),
		there is something wrong with its file header.
	<DT>Error: EOF <I>filename</I><DD>
		The file was shorter than expected. It may
		have been corrupted somehow.
	<DT>Error: IO<DD>
		Some problem while reading or writing a file.
		It might be due to the disk getting full while writing.
	<DT>Error: <I>filename line_number</I>: <I>message</I><DD>
		Syntax errors in Pixie Scripts are reported like this.
		The <I>filename</I> and <I>line_number</I> indicated
		where the error was found, and the <I>message</I> gives
		more information. Usually if you look at the line concerned
		you can see what has gone wrong. See also the Pixie Script
		<A HREF="PxsRef1.htm">reference section</A>.
</DL>
</UL>

<H4>ConvPxi warning messages
</H4><UL><P>
Here are the main warning messages ConvPxi may produce.
Generally they mean that although a Pixie image has been
produced, it probably won't look like what you expected.

<DL>
	<DT><P>Warning: record type <I>name</I> [<I>number</I>] was ignored<DD>
		The metafile contained information which ConvPxi was not able to
		convert.
		The name and number indicate the type of Metafile record
		that ConvPxi doesn't understand.
		See <A HREF="PixiRef1.htm#Unsupported">Bitmaps and other unsupported
		features</A> for more information.
	<DT>Warning: brush style <I>number</I> was ignored<DD>
		The metafile contained a fill pattern which ConvPxi was not able to
		convert.
		ConvPxi can only cope with solid fills.
	<DT>Warning: pen width <I>number</I> was ignored<DD>
		The metafile contained a thick line which ConvPxi was not able to
		convert. ConvPxi can only cope with thin lines.
	<DT>Warning: pen style <I>number</I> was ignored<DD>
		The metafile contained a line pattern which ConvPxi was not able to
		convert.
		ConvPxi can only cope with solid lines; not dotted or dashed.
	<DT>Warning: &quot;<I>name</I>&quot; is not a portable font name.<DD>
		The font face <I>name</I> is not one of the fonts listed
		in <A HREF="PixiRef1.htm#Fonts">Text and fonts</A>.
		The text might look alright on your machine, but wrong
		on a user's machine if it doesn't have the named font installed.
</DL>
</UL>

<A NAME="Applet"></A>
<H4>Viewer applet warning messages
</H4><UL><P>

Here are the main warning messages the Pixie.class and PixieSlide.class
applets may produce. They appear at the bottom of the applet's window.
All except the first begin with <I>SRC</I> - that is the URL
of the image as given by the <CODE>SRC</CODE> parameter,
which should help you locate the file causing the problem.

<DL>
	<DT><P>No SRC parameter<DD>
		The <CODE>NAME=Src VALUE=&quot;URL&quot;</CODE> line
		was missing from the <CODE>&lt;Applet&gt</CODE>; tag,
		so Pixie does not know what image file to use.
		See <A HREF="PixiRef2.htm">The basic HTML</A> for more information.
	<DT><I>SRC</I>: java.net.MalformedUrlException: <I>message</I><DD>
		Pixie did not understand what <I>SRC</I> means.
		The <I>message</I> gives more information.
	<DT><I>SRC</I>: java.io.FileNotFoundException: <I>URL</I><DD>
		<I>URL</I> is the full path to the image file, which
		could not be opened for some reason. Perhaps the
		path is misspelt or the file has moved, or the
		network connection is down.
	<DT><I>SRC</I>: java.io.IOException: <I>URL</I><DD>
		<I>URL</I> is the full path to the image file, which
		could not be opened for some reason. Perhaps the
		path is misspelt or the file has moved, or the
		network connection is down.
	<DT><I>SRC</I>: java.lang.Exception: Bad Pixie header<DD>
		The source file was found, but does not look like a proper
		Pixie image. Pixie files usually have an extension of .PXI.
		Perhaps some other file has been given that extension by mistake.
	<DT><I>SRC</I>: java.lang.Exception: Bad Pixie version <I>number</I><DD>
		The source file is a valid Pixie image, but of a version that
		this applet does not understand. For example, Pixie.class does
		not recognize the slide-show and hotspot features that PixieSlide
		uses.
	<DT><I>SRC</I>: java.lang.Exception: Unknown header command<DD>
		This usually means the image file has got corrupted somehow.
	<DT><I>SRC</I>: java.lang.Exception: Unknown record type <I>number</I><DD>
		This usually means the image file has got corrupted somehow.

<H1>Common Pixie Problems</H1>

This page is an attempt to list (and solve) the most common difficulties that people may have with Pixie.

<H4>Which should I be using - Pixie or PixieSlide?
</H4><UL><P>
Well, PixieSlide can do everything Pixie can.
Pixie uses a smaller viewer applet, but currently the difference
is only about 3k.
If you need the extra functionality of PixieSlide
- namely, slide shows and ImageMaps -
anywhere on your web site it is probably best to
use PixieSlide throughout, and not bother with Pixie.
That way visitors will only have to download one applet
rather than two.

<P>
If you don't need PixieSlide's extra features,
or if you are really concerned about initial delays
on the first page a visitor sees, use Pixie.

</UL>
<H4>I can't get the converter to work.
</H4><UL><P>

Try re-reading the sections
<A HREF="PixiRef1.htm#Batchfile">ConvPxi batchfile or shell script</A>
and <A HREF="PixiInst.htm#Converter">Running the Pixie converter</A>.
Also check the documentation on your Java interpreter - make sure
you can run other Java programs.
</UL>

<H4>The converter runs but produces a blank image
</H4><UL><P>

Does the converter produce a the message like:
"Warning: record type <I>name</I> [<I>number</I>] was ignored"?
This often means you are trying to convert a metafile that
contains nothing but one big bitmap.
Quite a lot of paint programs have an "Export as WMF" option
that produces files like this. Pixie can't do anything with these
metafiles because it is a vector program,
and they don't have any real vector information in them. You need
to use a vector graphics program to generate the metafile.
</UL>

<H4>When I print an HTML page, the Pixie image comes out blank
</H4><UL><P>

I'm sorry; the Pixie viewers don't currently support printing.
This is because the old versions of Java don't support it, and
if Pixie didn't use an old version of Java old browsers wouldn't
be able to see the images at all.
</UL>

<A NAME="BadBrowsers"></A>
<H4>A browser crashes or hangs on pages containing Pixie images
</H4><UL><P>

This is almost certainly a bug in the browser, not in Pixie.
The best solution is to upgrade the browser, because it
will probably crash with other Java applets as well.
With any power feature - JavaScript, frames, style sheets, forms, whatever
- there's always a chance that someone will bring out a new browser
that doesn't support it properly.
You and visitors to your site should be aware that using a newly released
product has a certain risk. If you can't tolerate that risk, don't use
Java applets such as Pixie on your site.

<P>
Actually there is another solution. Write a server-side CGI script
which detects the browser from the User-Agent field in HTTP headers,
and serves a non-Java version of the page if it is not sure the browser
can cope with Java. This approach is similar to using a .GIF as a fallback
for browsers which are not Java-enabled, except that it puts the intelligence
in the server instead of the browser.

<P>
Here are the browser versions that I know to have Java problems.
<DL>
	<DT><P><I>Netscape Navigator 4.02 and 4.03</I><DD>
		Sometimes hangs the first time it sees any Java or JavaScript page.
		Netscape Navigator 4.04 is OK, as is Netscape Communicator 3.03.
</DL>
<P>
Please let me know if you come across any other problems.
I will try to keep this list up to date.

<H1>Pixie and PixieSlide Feedback and Support</H1>

This page explains how to get in touch with the developers of Pixie.

<A NAME="Feedback"></A>
<H4>Feedback
</H4><UL><P>

For any further information,
to request new features,
or just to tell me how you are getting on,
please send email to
<A HREF="mailto:pixie@bhresearch.co.uk">pixie@bhresearch.co.uk</A>.

<P>
If you've used Pixie to make a cool website, let me know.
I'd like to keep a gallery of sites for people to look at.

<P>
If you have some ideas for new Pixie features,
I'm open to suggestions.
No guarantees though.

<P>
If you want to work with the Pixie source code yourself, see the
<A HREF="SrcInst.htm">Pixie Source Code</A> section.

<A NAME="Support"></A>
<H4>Support
</H4><UL><P>

Pixie and PixieSlide are free products,
which means there is no money to pay for support.
What follows is mostly to help you sort out any problems
yourself.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>First,</B> check for any warning messages that might give you a hint as
to what has gone wrong. Look them up in the list of
<A HREF="Messages.htm">Warning and error messages</A>.

<P>
<LI><B>Secondly,</B> look at the list of <A HREF="Problems.htm">Common Problems</A> to see if yours is listed.
(If it isn't, and you think it ought to be, let me know - even if you
eventually sort it out yourself.)

<P>
<LI><B>Thirdly,</B> re-read the documentation.
Especially the <A HREF="PixiRef1.htm">converter</A> and <A HREF="PixiRef2.htm">viewer</A> references,
and the <A HREF="PxsRef1.htm">PixieScript</A> language reference.
Perhaps something which wasn't clear to you the first time
through will make more sense now.

<P>
<LI><B>Fourthly,</B> read through the <A HREF="History.htm">release history</A>
to see if your problem is mentioned there, and
to make sure you have the most recent version of the files.
<P>
</UL>

Finally, if none of that helps, drop me a line at
<A HREF="mailto:pixie@bhresearch.co.uk">pixie@bhresearch.co.uk</A>.
and I'll do what I can.

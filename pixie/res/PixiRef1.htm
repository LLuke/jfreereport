<H1>Using the Pixie Converter</H1>

Once you have Pixie installed and running (see section
<A HREF="PixiInst.htm">PixiInst.htm</A>
for more details on that),
the following notes will help you get the most out of it.
<P>
This section is about the converter.
You have to convert images into Pixie's own .PXI file format
before the viewer applet can display them.
You do that just once for each image, using a Java application
that runs from the commandline prompt on your machine.
See <A HREF="PixiRef2.htm">Using the Pixie Viewer</A> to find out
what to do with the .PXI files once you've got them.

<A NAME="Batchfile"></A>
<H4>ConvPxi batchfile or shell script
</H4><UL><P>
The commandline to run the converter program is horrendously long,
so the first thing you will want to do is put it into a
batch file or shell script.
A sample batchfile for Windows is provided in the install archive,
called ConvPxi.bat,
which assumes that ConvPxi.zip is in the current directory.
A more realistic batch file would provide the full path of the
ConvPxi.zip file, so that it could be run from any directory.
It might look like:

<UL><CODE>
jre -cp C:/Pixie/ConvPxi.zip gnu.bhresearch.pixie.Convert %1 %2 %3 %4 %5</CODE>
</UL>

<P>
Something similar will work with other operating systems.

</UL>

<H4>Commandline arguments
</H4><UL><P>

You can provide ConvPxi with the filename on the commandline,
instead of having it prompt you.
The full commandline is:
<UL><CODE>
ConvPxi [-hv] [-r 999[,999]] infile [outfile.pxi]</CODE>
</UL>

<P>
Parameters in square brackets are optional. In more detail:
<DL>
    <DT><CODE>ConvPxi</CODE><DD>
	The batchfile that runs the Java interpreter on ConvPxi.
	<DT><CODE>-h</CODE><DD>
	Help - displays simple help about the program.
	<DT><CODE>-v</CODE><DD>
	Verbose - displays the version number and other information.
	This is useful for checking you have the latest version.
	<DT><CODE>-r</CODE><DD>
	Resolution - sets the width and height, in pixels, of the final image.
These are optional, but the results often look better,
and the Pixie file will be smaller, if you provide them.
If you provide one of them, it will try to work the other one out
for itself by using the aspect ratio of the original file.
	
	<DT><CODE>infile</CODE><DD>The name of the Windows metafile to convert.
	<DT><CODE>outfile.pxi</CODE><DD>The name of the .pxi file to produce.
	If you omit it, ConvPxi will add a .pxi extension to the input file.
	
</DL>

</UL>

<H4>Converter examples
</H4><UL><P>
Here is an example which uses all the common options:
<UL><CODE>
ConvPxi -v -r 600,400 Eg.wmf Eg.pxi</CODE>
</UL>

<P>
Here is the simplest example:
<UL><CODE>
ConvPxi Eg.wmf</CODE>
</UL>

</UL>

<A NAME="Unsupported"></A>
<H4>Bitmaps and other unsupported features
</H4><UL><P>
Pixie cannot convert all metafiles perfectly.
There are a number of drawing features which it will leave out.
These include:
<UL>
<LI>Bitmaps.
<LI>Thick outlines.
<LI>Round-cornered rectangles.
<LI>Pie-shapes.
<LI>Pattern fills.
</UL>

<P>
In practise Pixie reproduces over 90% of common metafiles,
but you should always check the output yourself.

</UL>

<A NAME="Fonts"></A>
<H4>Text and fonts
</H4><UL><P>
Pixie uses fonts from the browser to draw text.
This can be a problem.
If you use a font which visitors don't have installed,
Pixie will substitute a different one.
They will still be able to read the text,
but the exact appearance and positioning will be off.
It's safest to use one of the fonts from this list:

<UL>
<LI>Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica
<LI>Times New Roman, TimesRoman, adobe-times
<LI>Courier New, Courier, adobe-courier
<LI>MS Sans Serif,	Dialog, b&h-lucida
<LI>DialogInput, b&h-lucidatypewriter
<LI>WingDings, ZapfDingBats, itc-zapfdingbats
</UL>

<P>
The Pixie converter will warn you if you use any other font.

<P>
It is safest to use literal text only for mundane things,
like titles, or labelling diagrams,
where exact layout is not crucial.
For more artistic uses,
like logos and special effects,
you should convert the text into outlines
before producing the metafile.
Most good drawing programs offer a feature to do this.
The outlines take up more space in the file,
but they should be drawn much more accurately.

<H1>Pixie Source Code</H1>

This page describes how to download the Java source code for Pixie.class, PixieSlide.class and ConvPxi. It is mainly of interest to programmers.

<P>
Note, however, that the Pixie license does not allow you to give the Pixie.zip or PixiSlid.zip archives, or other parts of Pixie, to other people without making sure
they can also get the source code. For example, if you put Pixie.zip onto a CDROM you
should download and include PixieSrc.zip as well. So even non-programmers may need this
page.

<H4>License
</H4><UL><P>
The source code for Pixie is published
under the <A HREF="lgpl.htm">GNU Library General Public License</A>.
Briefly, this means you are free to modify it or redistribute it,
provided that everyone who gets a copy of the executable can also get a copy
of the source, and that they in turn have the same freedoms under the LGPL. 
It does <B>not</B> mean you are obliged to distribute your changes,
nor that you cannot charge a fee for doing so.

<P>You should read the license itself carefully before downloading the software.
In particular, you should note that Pixie comes with NO WARRANTY.
You are solely responsible for determining whether the software
is suitable for your purposes.
</UL>

<H4>Why LGPL?
</H4><UL><P>

I am quite proud of the Pixie format; it is much more compact
than anything else I've seen yet it doesn't take much Java code
to interpret it. I would like to see it adopted widely.
Making the source available is one way to encourage its use.

<P>
I am using the LGPL rather than the GPL because it is more open.
You can link LGPL code with other code without that other code
having to be covered by the LGPL, provided a few restrictions are
satisfied (see the license for details).
This makes it easier for you to use the Pixie format
in commercial products.

<P>
If you want to work on Pixie source code but consider even the LGPL
to be too restrictive, please
<A HREF="mailto:drh@bhresearch.co.uk">email me</A>
to see if we can negotiate a one-off license.
</UL>

<H4>Download
</H4><UL><P>
You can download the latest version of the Pixie source from:
<UL>
<A HREF="http://www.bhresearch.co.uk/Java/Pixie/PixieSrc.zip">
http://www.bhresearch.co.uk/Java/Pixie/PixieSrc.zip</A> (70k)
</UL>

<P>
The current version is <A HREF="History.htm">
1.13 (30th March 1998)
</A>.
</UL>

<H4>Installing and compiling
</H4><UL><P>

Most of the files from the PixieSrc.zip archive live in the package
&quot;gnu.bhresearch.pixie&quot;.
(The GNU folk seem to prefer the &quot;gnu.&quot; prefix over
&quot;ORG.gnu.&quot; or &quot;GNU.&quot;)
A handful of utility classes live in &quot;gnu.bhresearch.quant&quot;,
and the viewer applets live in the default unnamed package.
The only non-Java file is a copy of the LGPL license.

<P>
I don't use a makefile and haven't provided one. I compile using
the Java SDK 1.1.5, using &quot;javac -O *.java&quot;.
(This is plenty fast enough for me.)
All the code is pure Java.
It does not use any native methods or funny extensions.
You will get &quot;obsolete&quot; warnings because it is intended to
run on version 1.0.2 JVMs.

<P>
The source contains comments in JavaDoc format.
I haven't included them separately as HTML;
you can extract them yourself if you wish.
You will find the user documentation from
<A HREF="PixiInst.htm">Pixie.zip</A> and <A HREF="SlidInst.htm">PixiSlid.zip</A>
useful.

</UL>

<H4>Coordinating changes
</H4><UL><P>
Although you don't have to tell anyone you are working on the source,
I'd rather you at least told
<A HREF="mailto:pixie@bhresearch.co.uk">me</A>. That way I can help coordinate changes
and avoid the same work being done twice. I may also be able to give you advice
as to the best way to go about making a change.

<P>Check this page for to find details
of projects currently under way. (Currently there are none.)

<H1>Using the Pixie Viewer</H1>

This page discusses the Pixie viewer applet in more detail.
The viewer applet is what goes on your web page and displays the image,
so this page is mostly about HTML.
See <A HREF="PixiRef1.htm">Using the Pixie Converter</A> to find out
how to create image files to view in the first place,
The <A HREF="PixiInst.htm#Viewer">Install page</A>
briefly explains what files you need to transfer to your
server for the viewer to work.

<H4>The basic HTML
</H4><UL><P>

Here's the test <CODE>&lt;APPLET&gt;</CODE> example we used earlier:
<UL><CODE>
&lt;APPLET CODE=&quot;Pixie.class&quot; WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=300&gt;<BR>
&lt;PARAM NAME=Src VALUE=&quot;Eg.pxi&quot;&gt;<BR>
&lt;/APPLET&gt;<BR></CODE>
</UL>

<P>
Here is what the various parts mean.
<DL>
	<DT><CODE>CODE=&quot;Pixie.class&quot;</CODE><DD>
	This sets the name of the Java applet itself.
If you use Pixie images on several pages, make them all share
the same copy of Pixie.class.
That way browsers will only download it for the first page.
All the subsequent pages will use the copy in the browser's cache,
which will be much faster.
It'll make it easier for you to manage your site, too.

	<DT><CODE>WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=300</CODE><DD>
	These tell the browser the size of the image, in pixels.
	If you specified a size by using &quot;-r&quot;
	when you created the file with the
	converter, you should use the same size here.
	
	<DT><CODE>NAME=Src VALUE=&quot;Eg.pxi&quot;</CODE><DD>
	All &lt;PARAM&gt; tags are passed on to the applet.
	The &quot;Src&quot; one sets the name of the Pixie
	file to use.
	Again, if you want the same image on two pages
	make sure they share the same file, so that
	browsers can cache it.
</DL>

</UL>

<H4>Background color
</H4><UL><P>
For some pictures, the background color of the applet shows
through behind the image.
This happens when the picture is drawn with holes in it, so that it doesn't 
completely fill its rectangle.
The viewer applet tries to match its background to the color of
the page, but often doesn't succeed and the result can
be an ugly rectangle around the image.
You can fix this by forcing both the page background and the
applet background to the same color,
so that they blend in together.

<P>
To change the background color of the web page,
for example to white, add a <CODE>BGCOLOR</CODE> attribute to its
<CODE>&lt;BODY&gt;</CODE> tag:
<UL><CODE>
&lt;BODY BGCOLOR=&quot;#ffffff&quot; TEXT=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;</CODE>
</UL>
<P>
This example also changes the text color to black,
to avoid getting white text on a white background.
You may want to change the link colors too.
This is standard HTML, not part of Pixie,
so you can consult your HTML reference for more information.

<P>
To change the background color of the viewer applet to white,
use a <CODE>&lt;PARAM&gt;</CODE> like this:
<UL><CODE>
&lt;PARAM NAME=BGCOLOR VALUE=&quot;#ffffff&quot;&gt;<BR></CODE>
</UL>
<P>
This must go between the <CODE>&lt;APPLET&gt;</CODE> and <CODE>&lt;/APPLET&gt;</CODE> tags.

</UL>

<H4>Color depth
</H4><UL><P>
Some pictures need more than 256 colors to look right,
but you don't know in advance how many colors
visitor's browsers support.
But the Pixie applet does.
Pixie lets you provide a second .PXI file which it will
use if the browser has 256 colors or less.
Only one of the two files will be downloaded.

<P>
You set this with another <CODE>&lt;PARAM&gt;</CODE> tag:
<UL><CODE>
&lt;PARAM NAME=SRC VALUE=&quot;Eg.pxi&quot;&gt;<BR>
&lt;PARAM NAME=SRC8 VALUE=&quot;Eg8.pxi&quot;&gt;<BR></CODE>
</UL>

<P>
Again this must go between the <CODE>&lt;APPLET&gt;</CODE> and <CODE>&lt;/APPLET&gt;</CODE> tags.
The &quot;8&quot; in &quot;SRC8&quot; means a
color depth of 8 bits per pixel.

<P>
When designing an 8-bit picture,
you should consider confining yourself to
the "browser safe" palette.
This is a palette of the 216 colors that most
browsers are most likely to be able to display correctly.
See <A HREF="http://www.webreference.com/dev/graphics/palette.html">Which Color Palette?</A> for more information.

<CODE>Non-Java browsers</CODE>
The Pixie viewer is a Java applet.
Not all browsers support Java,
and in those that do, users sometimes turn it off.
Fortunately the HTML standard is designed to degrade gracefully.
You can put normal HTML between the <CODE>&lt;APPLET&gt</CODE> and <CODE>&lt;/APPLET&gt;</CODE> tags,
and it will be used if the browser does not have Java enabled.

<P>
You could, for example, include an <CODE>&lt;IMG&gt;</CODE> tag with a .GIF
version of the Pixie image, as a fallback for people with old browsers,
or who turn Java off for security reasons.
It will only be downloaded if it's needed.

</UL>

<H4>Text-only browsers
</H4><UL><P>
Many people can't see images - blind people, obviously,
but also normal people with slow Internet connections may
turn graphics off.
Search engines in particular, rarely index pictures.
Generally, then,
you should make sure that the important information
of a Pixie image is also available as normal HTML text.
This means you might have:
<UL>
<LI>a full color Pixie image,
<LI>a 256 color Pixie image for browsers with limited color,
<LI>a GIF image for browsers without Java,
<LI>and some pure text for text-only browsers.
</UL>
<P>
All for the same information.

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.anybrowser.org/campaign/">Best Viewed With Any Browser</A>
is a good starting point for information on why such fallbacks are
a good idea and how to implement them.

</UL>

<H4>Another HTML example
</H4><UL><P>
Here is a complete example,
which combines all of the points discussed in this section.
<UL><CODE>
&lt;BODY BGCOLOR=&quot;#ffffff&quot; TEXT=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;<BR>
&lt;APPLET CODE=&quot;Pixie.class&quot; WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=300&gt;<BR>
&lt;PARAM NAME=SRC VALUE=&quot;Eg.pxi&quot;&gt;<BR>
&lt;PARAM NAME=SRC8 VALUE=&quot;Eg8.pxi&quot;&gt;<BR>
&lt;PARAM NAME=BGCOLOR VALUE=&quot;#ffffff&quot;&gt;<BR>
&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;Eg.gif&quot; WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=300<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ALT=&quot;PIXIE - Tiny pictures for the web&quot;&gt;<BR>
To see this Pixie example, you need a Java-capable browser with
Java turned on.<BR> 
&lt;/APPLET&gt;<BR>
&lt;/BODY&gt;</CODE>
</UL>

<P>
Note the ALT text in the &lt;IMG&gt; tag.
</UL>

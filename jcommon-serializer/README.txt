-----------------
1.  INTRODUCTION
-----------------
JCommon is a free general purpose Java class library that is used in
several projects at www.jfree.org, including JFreeChart and
JFreeReport.

This library module contains a general serialization framework. It simplifies
the task of writing custom serialization handlers for non-serializable classes.

JCommon-Serializer is licensed, free of charge, under the terms of the GNU Lesser
General Public Licence.  A copy of the licence is included in the download.

2. REQUIREMENTS
---------------
JCommon-Serializer needs at least JDK 1.2.2 for its core functionality.

----------
Free support is available via the Pentaho forum, follow the link

4. REPORTING BUGS

If you find bugs in JCommon-Serializer, we'd like to hear about it so that we

We use an open source build tool called Ant to build JCommon-Serializer.  An
Ant script (tested using Ant 1.5.4) is included in the distribution:

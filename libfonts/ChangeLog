1.  WHAT's NEW
---------------
A list of changes in recent versions:

0.2.6: (27-May-2007)
        * Implemented the Grapheme-Cluster algorithm as specified by the Unicode
          UAX#29 document.

0.2.5: (21-May-2007)
        * Added explicit monospace-font support. This is faster than rerouting all
          requests to a real monospaced-font.

0.2.4: (27-Apr-2007)
        * Added Font-Metrics caching to the AWT-FontMetrics for ASCII and ISO-8859-1
          characters.

        * Moved the Text-Classifiers implementations from LibLayout into LibFonts.

0.2.3: (01-Mar-2007)
        * LibLoader changed the way resource-keys are managed.

0.2.2: (03-Dec-2006)
        * AWT-FontMetrics caching

        * Encoding API fixes

0.2.1: (26-Sep-2006)
        * Libraries updated to latest releases

0.1.9: (29-Jun-2006)
        * [BUG] Oblique and Italics detection was weird and wrong.

        * [BUG] CodePointBuffer and ByteBuffer classes made a boo on copying the
          internal buffers.

0.1.8: (30-May-2006)
        * Updated the libraries and all code that depends on them.

0.1.7: (30-Apr-2006)
        * [BUG] Missing or invalid encoding implementations interrupted the
          font registration process. Missing encodings are now replaced by
          internal UTF-32-aware encoding implementations.

        * LibFonts is now dependent on LibLoader for loading external encodings.

0.1.6: (17-Apr-2006)
        * BugFixes

0.1.4: (27-Jan-2006)
        * restructuring and more font reading

        * recognizes italic and oblique fonts.

        * Support AWT and TrueType fonts using an common interface.

0.1.1: (21-Nov-2005)
        * [BUG] All names should be used, when looking for font family names.

0.1.0: (09-Nov-2005)
        * Reading the 'name', 'head' and 'OS/2' table for truetype files is
          implemented. This is all that is needed to successfully register
          fonts.

        * A serializable 'FontRegistry' loads all available fonts from the system
          directories. It can be stored and reloaded, as this implementation is no
          singleton anymore.

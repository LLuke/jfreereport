1.  WHAT's NEW

A list of changes in recent versions:

0.1.9: (29-Jun-2006)
        * [BUG] Oblique and Italics detection was weird and wrong.
		
		* [BUG] CodePointBuffer and ByteBuffer classes made a boo on copying the
		  internal buffers.
        
0.1.8: (30-May-2006)
        * Updated the libraries and all code that depends on them.
        
0.1.7: (30-Apr-2006)
        * [BUG] Missing or invalid encoding implementations interrupted the
          font registration process. Missing encodings are now replaced by
          internal UTF-32-aware encoding implementations.

        * LibFonts is now dependent on LibLoader for loading external encodings.

0.1.6: (17-Apr-2006)
        * BugFixes

0.1.4: (27-Jan-2006)
        * restructuring and more font reading

        * recognizes italic and oblique fonts.

        * Support AWT and TrueType fonts using an common interface.

0.1.1: (21-Nov-2005)
        * [BUG] All names should be used, when looking for font family names.

0.1.0: (09-Nov-2005)
        * Reading the 'name', 'head' and 'OS/2' table for truetype files is
          implemented. This is all that is needed to successfully register
          fonts.

        * A serializable 'FontRegistry' loads all available fonts from the system
          directories. It can be stored and reloaded, as this implementation is no
          singleton anymore.

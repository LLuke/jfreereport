1.  WHAT's NEW
---------------
A list of changes in recent versions:

09-Nov-2005: Version 0.1.0:
    * Reading the 'name', 'head' and 'OS/2' table for truetype files is
      implemented. This is all that is needed to successfully register
      fonts.

    * A serializable 'FontRegistry' loads all available fonts from the system
      directories. It can be stored and reloaded, as this implementation is no
      singleton anymore.

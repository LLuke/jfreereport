A list of changes in recent versions:
	* recognizes italic and oblique fonts.

21-Nov-2005: Version 0.1.1:
    * [BUG] All names should be used, when looking for font family names. 

09-Nov-2005: Version 0.1.0:
    * Reading the 'name', 'head' and 'OS/2' table for truetype files is
      implemented. This is all that is needed to successfully register
      fonts.

    * A serializable 'FontRegistry' loads all available fonts from the system
      directories. It can be stored and reloaded, as this implementation is no
      singleton anymore.

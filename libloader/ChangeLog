A list of changes in recent versions:

0.2.1:  (11-Dec-2006)
        * [BUG] File-URLs failed with LibLoader if the URL's file part was 
          URL-Encoded. We now use a special handler for these cases.

0.2.0:  (03-Dec-2006)
        * This is the first real release version of LibLoader. At this
          point this library has some primitive caching and does a good
          job at loading resources.

0.1.5: (26-Sep-2006)
        * Limited the size of resources that are held in memory to 512kb.

0.1.4: (31-Aug-2006)
0.1.3: (30-Jul-2006)
0.1.2: (30-May-2006)
0.1.1: (30-Apr-2006)
        * New factory implementation for loading properties.

        * [BUG] Fixes in the resource and zip-loader implementations for dealing
          with derived keys.

0.1.0: (17-Apr-2006)
        * Initial public version.

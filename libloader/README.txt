1. INTRODUCTION
---------------
LibLoader is a general purpose resource loading framework. It has been
designed to allow to load resources from any physical location and to
allow the processing of that content data in a generic way, totally
transparent to the user of that library.

For the latest news and information about LibLoader, please refer to:

    http://jfreereport.pentaho.org/libloader/


2. REQUIREMENTS
---------------
LibLoader needs at least JDK 1.2.2 for its core functionality.

The EHCache support requires at least JDK 1.4. This module is therefore not
included by default. It can be built manually using the supplied ANT-script.


3. SUPPORT
----------
Free support is available via the Pentaho forum, follow the link
from the home page.  Please note that questions are answered by volunteers, 
so there is no guaranteed response time or level of service.

Please avoid e-mailing the developers directly for support questions.
If you post a message in the forum, then everyone can see the
question, and everyone can see the answer.

4. REPORTING BUGS
-----------------
If you find bugs in JFreeReport, we'd like to hear about it so that we
can improve future releases of JFreeReport.  Please post a bug report
at the JFreeReport project page on SourceForge:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/jfreereport

Please be sure to provide as much information as you can.  We need to
know the version of JFreeReport that you are using, the JDK version,
and the steps required to replicate the bug.  Include any other
information that you think is relevant.


5. ANT
------
We use an open source build tool called Ant to build JFreeReport.  An
Ant script (tested using Ant 1.5.4) is included in the distribution:

    <libfonts-directory>/ant/build.xml

You can find out more about Ant at:
